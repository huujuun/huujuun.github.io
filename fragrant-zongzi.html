    <h3>Legend of Zongzi</h3>

<p>Zongzi is traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival or Dragon Boat Festival which falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar (approximately early- or mid-June),commemorating the death of Qu Yuan. Born in Zigui County in present-day Hubei Province, Qu Yuan was a high-ranking official of the state of Chu. A patriot, he was deeply concerned with the fate of his government. At that time, his homeland was under siege by another powerful state called Qin. Qu Yuan advocated a series of policies enriching the country and strengthening its military forces so as to fight against Qin. However, the king did not accept his advice, and banished Qu Yuan to a remote area. Although exiled, Qu Yuan did not give up. He traveled extensively, taught, and wrote about his ideas. In 278 B.C., the Qin troops captured the capital of Chu. When Qu Yuan heard the news, he was filled with grief and disillusionment. He reached the Miluo River of present- day Hunan Province. Composing his last beautiful poem, a summary of his life, works, ideas, and achievements, and bidding a farewell to the world, his country, and the king, he threw himself into the Miluo River. When local people heard the sad news, they crowded to the riverbank and paid their respects to him. The fishermen sailed their boats up and down the river to look for his body. People threw zongzi and boiled eggs into the water to divert fish from nibbling his body. The tragedy happened on the fifth day of the fifth month on the Chinese lunar calendar. From this story came the tradition of the Dragon Boat Race and eating  zongzi.</p>

<h3>Variations of Zongzi</h3>

<p>Zongzi is wrapped in leaves of wild rice, palm, or bamboo. Each kind of leaf imparts its own unique smell and flavor to the glutinous rice which acts as the major component of zongzi. The filings used for zongzi vary from region to region. Fillings may be sweet, with skinless mung beans, red bean paste, jujubes, or savory with fillings such as, char “siu” (Chinese barbecue pork). Zongzi is often made of glutinous rice mixed with dates in northern China because dates are abundant in the area. Eastern China’s Jiaxing City is famous for its pork- stuffed zongzi. In the southern province of Guangdong, people stuff zongzi with pork, ham, chestnuts, and other ingredients, making them very rich in flavor, The glutinous rice used in zongzi, needs to be steamed or boiled for several hours depending on how it is treated prior to filing. Depending on the region, the rice may be lightly precooked by stir-frying or soaked before using. Once cooked, zongzi can easily be frozen for later consumption. Frozen zongzi are available for sale in many Chinese markets.</p>
