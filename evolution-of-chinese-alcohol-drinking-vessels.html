    <p>Alcohol drinking vessels not only have a practical use in storing, pouring, and drinking alcohols, but also have a deep cultural and aesthetic value. From the drinking vessels used, it is also possible to determine the status of a person. The drinking vessel, like many things in Chinese culture, varies according to the social development in external appearance, materials, and technologies applied.</p>

<h3>Kaleidoscope of Alcohol-Drinking Vessels</h3>

<p>Chinese drinking vessels come in various shapes: Zun - a liquor storage vessel with a wide mouth, high neck and round or square base, Jue - a vessel used for heating liquor, which has three feet, Jiao a vessel for drinking liquor with two sharp angles in the neck, Gong a vessel for the storage and drinking of liquor, like a thwart horn with a round base and a cover, and shaped like an animal. According to the materials of manufacture, the drinking vessels fall into pottery, porcelain, bronze, lacquerware, jade, glass, etc.</p>

<p>Pottery drinking vessels are the earliest examples discovered in China. They appeared during the colored pottery cultural period of the Neolithic Age. Due to the easy access of raw materials, the pottery drinking vessels continued in use through to the later dynasties, especially among people of the lower class.</p>

<p>During the later Xia, Shang and Western Zhou dynasties, with the increasingly wide use of bronze ware, the status of pottery vessels was gradually replaced by those made of bronze. Drinking vessels in the form of animals, such as elephant, OX, sheep, and tiger, were very popular then.</p>

<p>During the Eastern Zhou, Qin, Han, and Jin dynasties, the most popular were the brilliant and beautiful lacquer vessels, with the most prized ones coming from Sichuan Province. As it was the custom for people in the Han Dynasty to sit on the floor of their dwellings, the vessels would have been set there for them. This meant that the shapes tended to be low and chunky, often with ear-like handles. Excavation of the Mawangdui Han Tombs, revealed some 90 ear-handled cups that were evidence of the artistic skills employed in their production.</p>

<p>The porcelain drinking vessels also appeared in this period. The design of porcelain vessels during the Tang Dynasty surpassed any that had gone before and they were much smaller and more delicate. This material continued to be used until the Ming and Qing dynasties. The bowls and stoups with their blue and white flower patterns were quite an art. The porcelain drinking vessels manufactured in Jingde Town of Jiangxi Province were well-known. However, during the later Sui and Tang dynasties, gold and silver drinking vessels took center stage for a time.</p>

<p>In ancient China, there were also other unique drinking vessels, which, though not as popular, held great appreciation. These included ivory, jade, glass, wood, bamboo, tin, and osseous drinking vessels. In Beijing’s Beihai Park there is a large urn made of one piece of black jade that weighs 3500 kilograms and that can hold 1800 kilograms. On its exterior there are powerful engravings of living dragons and beasts emerging from waves. It is said that this urn was ordered to be made in 1256 by the Yuan Dynasty’s first emperor to reward heroes at a great feast.</p>

<h3>Drinking Vessels Nowadays</h3>

<p>In both the neoteric and present times, Chinese drinking vessels have also experienced rapid changes. The storage vessels of liquor are bottles and jars while beers are stored in bottles, kegs, and cans. Moreover, the vessels for drinking are inclined to be the smaller cups mainly made of glass and porcelain. Nowadays, factories also tend to produce some vessels that can have a dual use, both storage and drinking. In addition, various foreign liquors and their drinking vessels have also entered China, primarily to be found in the starred hotels, restaurants, and bars.</p>
