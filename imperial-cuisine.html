    <p>Ever since there were emperors and palaces, there has been imperial food, which was served mainly to the emperors, their wives and concubines, and the royal families. Emperors used their power to collect the best delicacies and called upon the best cooks to make delicious food for them. Imperial food, to some extent, represents a dynasty’s best cuisine.</p>

<h3>The Xia Dynasty</h3>

<p>With the construction of the Xia Dynasty palace and the establishment of the imperial court, an organization was set up to prepare and serve food to the emperor and empress, and officials were appointed for this purpose. Royalty began seeking pleasures, and an imperial kitchen system was conceived. Altogether, there were 22 departments with more than 2300 staff members. Thus it can be seen that the organization surrounding the imperial foods in the Zhou Dynasty was huge, the establishment was complete, and the division of labor was detailed and clear.</p>

<h3>The Zhou Dynasty</h3>

<p>The imperial cuisine of the Zhou Dynasty was a great improvement over those of the Xía and Shang dynasties. During the Zhou Dynasty, Chinese imperial cuisine took shape with a complete system. Everything was done in a fixed order in accordance with the eating rites. According to The Rites of the Zhou Dynasty, there were 26 bowls for the emperor, 16 for the princes and dukes, 13 for the marquis, 8 for the senior officials, and 6 for the junior officials.</p>

<h3>The Han and Wei Dynasties</h3>

<p>During the Han and Wei dynasties, imperial food followed thesystem initiated in the Zhou Dynasty, By this time, China’sstrengthened economy and its cuItural exchanges with othercountries had provided new sources of raw materials, better cookingutensils and cooking skills, and higher standards for imperial dishes.Imperial Kitchens of the Han Dynasty grew vegetables inhothouses, so their availability was not limited by the season.</p>

<h3>Southern and Northern Dynasties</h3>

<p>Buddhism was spreading in China by the time of theSouthern and Northern dynasties. Vegetariandishes began appearing because the Buddhistmonks only ate vegetarian food. In responseto the demand for vegetarian dishes, Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty introduced the use of gluten.</p>

<h3>The Sui Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, and Song Dynasty</h3>

<p>The imperial food of the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties followed the system and rules of the preceding dynasties, but the varieties of food and meal procedures changed tremendously, More attention was paid to their flavor,  taste,  color ,presentation, and naming. Famous imperial dishes developed during these periods that have been passed down to today include fried ringing bells, quick-fried prawns, crab rolls, crystal dragon and phoenix cakes, and steamed Mandarin fish.</p>

<h3>The Qing Dynasty</h3>

<p>During the Qing Dynasty, the rites for meals, the number of people, and the use, cost, variety, and quality of courses at each meal were the greatest of all the dynasties in China. Foods in the palace comprised Manchu dishes, Han dishes, and dishes cooked in both southern and northern styles. These foods reflected multiple nationalities of the Qing Dynasty as well as the colorful dietetic culture. What the Chinese eat today is mostly a continuation of the dietetic culture of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
