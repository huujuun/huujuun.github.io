    <p>Four properties and five favors of Chinese herbal medicine are the essential part of the elementary therapies of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine). They are also important in the nature of food. In food therapy, foods of different properties and favors are used to balance a person’s Yin and Yang, strengthen resistance and eliminate pathogens, and help people recuperate.</p>

<p>The four natures (hot, warm, cool and cold) refer to cold and hot natures. Cool and cold are of the same kind. Cool is inferior to cold.  Warm and hot are of the same kind. Warm is inferior to hot. Cold and Cool are two of a kind, while Cool is secondary to Cold. There is another nature called neutral nature, whose medicinal preferences for cold or hot are inconspicuous. Food’s four natures (hot, warm, cool and cold) determine the effect they have on bodies. The food that can imbalance hot state, protect YIN-fuid and alleviate or eliminate heat syndromes are thus of cold or cool nature. For example, food likes watermelon or pears, which can remove heat, promote salivation and quench thirst, are cold and cool natured. Hot and warm foods can strengthen Yan Qi, imbalance cold state, relieve or eliminate cold diseases. For example, people who are afraid of cold and deficient of Yang Qi, can eat mutton, or venison, to warm the middle-energizer and withstand cold, Fresh Ginger combined with brown sugar can treat cold pain in the digestive system, by warming the middle-energizer to expel cold.</p>

<p>Five favors include Pungent, Sweet (bland), Sour (astringent), Bitter and Salty the five favors are not only the sense of taste, but also a summarization of theories. Food with different favors will demonstrate different functions.</p>

<p>The Pungent flavor has the characteristic of dispersing, moving qi and activating blood. For example, Fresh Ginger, coriander and shallot are used to treat exterior syndromes. Whereas,  Dried Tangerine Peel and Long stamen Onion Bulb are utilized in the treatment of qi-stagnation and blood stasis.</p>

<p>The Sweet flavor has the function of replenishing the deficiencies and harmonizing the middle ener gizer and relieving spasm and pain. For example, Chinese yam and Jujube are used to treat a weak body or deficiency syndrome; rhizoma dioscoreae and mel are used to treat contracture abdominalgia; Wolfberry Fruit and longan are utilized in the treatment of blood deficiency syndrome.</p>

<p>The Sour flavor has the function of stopping sweating, treating diarrhoea and preventing spermatorrhea. For instance, fructus schisandrae is utilized for the following: incessant perspiration caused by weakness, chronic diarrhea and seminal emission.</p>

<p>The Bitter favor has the function of clearing heat and purging fre, discharging stool and relieving cough and dyspnea. For example, Momordica charantia L and mustard are used to treat heat syndromes.</p>

<p>The Salty flavor has the function of softening hardness, moistening the intestines and warming the kidneys. Salty medicinal like sea-tangle and sar-gassum are often used for syndromes, such as scrofula, phlegm and abdominal mass. Jellyfish and laver are suitable for constipation due to dry feces. Mussels, prawns and holothurian can tonify kidney.</p>

<p>The Bland favor has the action of draining dampness and promoting diuresis. Bland favor medicinal, such as semen coicis, winter melon, and calabash are used to treat edema and dysuria.</p>

<p>Sweet favor and bland favor medicinal are the most frequently used in Food Therapy. Salty and sour medicinal the second, Pungent the third, and Bitter the least.</p>
