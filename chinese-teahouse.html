    <p>Teahouses are almost as old as tea production in China, and form an integral part of China’s unique tea culture. Teahouses appeared throughout urban and rural China as early as the Tang Dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty, going to teahouses was a very common practice. Storytellers and folk singers were often hired to enliven the atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Teahouses</h3>

<p>Sichuan is one of the earliest places that produce tea, so there are a large number of teahouses there. ln Sichuan, in fact, there are three places in a person’s day: home, office and teahouse. Despite some distinction between the teahouses, their interior is invariably the same: bamboo chairs, square tables, calligraphies evoking the teahouses’ atmosphere and the typical Sichuan tea set - the Gaiwancha. This tea set, which is only used in Sichuan, includes three pieces: the saucer, the cup, and the cover. Drinking tea is not the exclusive pleasure of going to the teahouse. Other leisure activities comprise reading newspapers and playing Chinese chess or mahjong. Sichuan people flock to teahouses to chat and exchange news and gossip.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Teahouses</h3>

<p>Centered by Taihu Lake, Wuyue culture has influenced today’s Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, northeastern Jiangxi and eastern Anhui. Wuyue culture has brought the style of tea cultures to the south of Yangtze River where there are beautiful hills and streams. Favorably situated close to the East Sea, this area enjoys an appropriate climate for producing tea as well as artistic surroundings for tasting tea. Thus, teahouses there do not need fine decoration, for the nature and the buildings seem to blend into each other. Wuyue is famous for Buddhism and Taoism, so in the West Lake teahouses, it seems that one can smell the holiness of celestial beings and feel Buddha’s existence. Teahouses in Hangzhou can be summarized with one word true. The present teahouses in the Wuyue area are fewer than those in Sichuan Province, for most of Zhejiang people drink tea at home. However, the cultural atmosphere of Hangzhou tearooms is much stronger.</p>

<h3>Beijing Teahouses</h3>

<p>In 1988, Laoshe Teahouse opened for business as the first teahouse in new Beijing, marking the rejuvenation of the teahouse culture of old Beijing. Beijing’s teahouses are characterized by their diversity, multiple functions, and richness in cultural background. Chinese traditional art performances, for example, pingshu (storytelling by a professional storyteller), danxian (story-telling and singing to musical accompaniment), big drum (versified story sung with the accompaniment of a small drum and other instruments) or cross talk, mostly have come into being in the teahouses.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Teahouses</h3>

<p>Drinking tea is a symbol of Guangdong people’s everyday life, and it has to be in teahouses. Drinking tea at home simply doesn’t count. The Cantonese have a custom of drinking tea with dim sum. Cantonese call it yum cha， which literally means“drinking tea”. The tea drinking tradition can be traced back a hundred years to the Qing Dynasty. In those days, the Cantonese used to go to a nearby teahouse, like the popular “Two-Cent Teahouse” , where they needed to pay only two cents for a pot of tea and some simple snacks.  The customers were mostly temporary laborers, who couldn’t afford anything costing more. By the later Qing Period, teahouses in the true sense emerged in Guangzhou. These were more expensive places offering much better tea with a variety of delicacies. If you are staying in Guangzhou and want to know about the local customs, are commendable way is to join the Cantonese in their passion for morning tea. In the midst of the crowds of Cantonese teahouse goers , you may get a better idea of what life is like in Guangzhou.</p>

<h3>Chinese drama Teahouse</h3>

<p>When the curtains rose at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington D.C. in late October 2005, the sight of a bustling Beijing teahouse, circa 1898, took audiences by surprise. Since its premiere in 1958, Teahouse has had a cumulative run of more than 500 shows, which is a rare triumph in China. Teahouse was the first Chinese drama production presented in the US. The difficulty of presenting a Chinese-language play was obvious. However, American audiences were more responsive than a typical Beijing audience. There were other forces at play as well. To start with, a significant portion of the audiences were Chinese Americans, with various degrees of familiarity with the language. For those curious about a Chinese play but with no prior knowledge, the Kennedy Center had educational programmers before the opening and even a panel discussion with the actors on board. To achieve the best possible attendance, the Kennedy Center kept ticket prices affordable. At US$22-55 apiece , the tickets were sold out.</p>
