    <p>As its name suggests, the Tea-Horse Road was a central trade route for exchanging Tibetan horses and Han people’s tea. The road stretched more than 4,000kilometers, mainly through Southwest China’s Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. This ancient commercial passage promoted exchanges in culture and religion, and saw ethnic migration that closely resembled what was experienced on the well-known Silk Road.</p>

<h3>Origin of the Tea-Horse Road</h3>

<p>Puer tea is most favored by the Tibetan people since the butter tea made of Pu’er tea is highly esteemed both in taste and in color. Tibet’s rugged climate and frigid winters did not allow for the growing of tea, so local traders looked outward for suppliers. Neighboring Yunnan’s climate was ideal for the large-leaved plants needed for Puer and they grew in great quantity. Local merchants began to traverse the steep mountains of western China to satisfy Tibet’s growing thirst. While abundant in tea, Yunnan had its own shortcoming. The Han military lacked strong horses, critical for fighting hostile neighbors from the north and west. Traders from the Tibetan areas seized upon this imbalance and made an excellent profit on the exchange of tea for the stunningly powerful local horses.</p>

<h3>The Rise and Fall</h3>

<p>The development of large-scale commerce in tea and horses between the Chinese dynasties and Tibet, and the development of the caravan road for the tea and horse trade probably date to the Song Dynasty. The Song court required a large number of warhorses from Tibet to defend against the invading northern nomadic Liao, Jin, and Xixia. The court established the Chamasi (tea and horse office) in charge of the tea and horse trade and setup many markets for selling tea and buying horses in Northwest China. The Yuan Dynasty also paid great attention to the trade of tea to Tibet and established the bureau in charge of tea trade to Tibet. At first, tea was sold through the government bureau, but later it was gradually handled by individual traders. The most prosperous period for the tea and horse trade was under the Ming Dynasty. The quality of the horses offered to the court by the Tibetans as “tribute” determined the quality of the tea. During the Qing Dynasty, the fifth Dalai Lama asked the Qing Court to setup a large market exclusively for the tea and horse trade, and his request was approved by the central court. From then on, there was a rapid increase in the amount of Yunnan tea transported to Tibet along the Tea-Horse Road. During the Republic Period, although the government did not play an important role in the tea trade, it continued to prosper in the hands of private traders, who still traveled along the Tea Horse Road.</p>

<h3>Culture Trodden by Feet</h3>

<p>The Tea-Horse Road was an important thread of natural and cultural tourism. Natural wonders, civilization heritages, marks of ancient ethnic customs, and countless romantic stories were spread along the road. Along the ancient road lived more than 20ethnic groups. What the Tea-Horse Road functioned more than anything else was to connect different peoples, and give societies a link to something beyond their own villages. Concentrations of beautiful and mysterious natural landscapes and traditional cultures have developed in various sites, including Dali old city, Lijiang old city, and Shangrila. In addition, Tibetan Buddhism has provided widespread doctrine on the Tea-Horse Road, further promoting economic dialogues and cultural exchanges.</p>

<h3>Film and Tea-Horse Road</h3>

<p>Directed by the fifth generation Chinese filmmaker, Tian Zhuangzhuang, Delamu documents the people living in the Nujiang River Valley along the Tea-Horse Road. The title, Delamu refers to the Tibetan word for peaceful angel. As Tian travels with the caravan, he interviews people who have lived along the road for decades. After watching Delamu, Martin Scorsese, a famous director in the United States, wrote  to Tian Zhuangzhuang  expressing  his excitement. In the letter, he said he was stunned bythe documentary, which deeply moved him, especially its music, image, and happy and auspicious atmosphere. Displaying the harmonious blend of different religions and cultures in the area along the Tea-Horse Road, it is a poetic work and a perpetual teaching book of history. According to a review by A.O. Scott, a renowned critic of the New York Times, Delamu is a great documentary film in terms of quality and artistry. It captures the scenery in remote China, which is natural and incredible and has a strong appeal for people in cities.</p>
