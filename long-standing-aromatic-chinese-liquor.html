    <p>Chinese liquor is one of the six world-famous varieties of liquors, the other five being brandy, whisky, rum, vodka, and gin. Foreign visitors coming across Chinese liquor for the first time may be a little wary of it. However, once they have tasted a sample or two, they may well acquire a taste for the various drinks available and find they really enjoy Chinese liquor.</p>

<h3>Legends About Origins of Chinese Liquor</h3>

<p>At the time when the ancestors of Chinese people gave up their nomadic lifestyle and opted to live in compact communities in the Yellow River Valley, the plantation of various kinds of grain laid the foundation for making tempting liquors. It is said that the technique of making Chinese liquor originated in the Xia Dynasty. Yi Di and Du Kang are considered to be two founding fathers of the profession of making liquor. According to historical records, it was Yi Di who made great efforts to make mellow liquor with fermented glutinous rice at the order of the monarch Yu. The liquor made by Yi Di tasted good. She presented samples of the top-notch liquor to Yu, hoping to receive rewards. After tasting the liquor, Yu was satisfied with its unparalleled taste. However, the monarch set no store by the liquor producer’s ability. The monarch estranged himself from Yi Di instead of giving rewards. In the eyes of the monarch, the mesmerizing liquor was wicked because indulging in excessive drinking could make him lose his reason and harm his country.</p>

<p>Du Kang, living in the Xia Dynasty, is also credited with making top-notch liquor with Chinese sorghum. According to historical legends, Du Kang stored some cooked Chinese sorghum seeds inside a hollow tree stump on a winter day. In the spring of the following year, a fragrant aroma wafted from the tree stump into Du Kang’s nostrils. Afterwards, Du Kang found that it was the fermented sorghum seeds which gave off the alluring fragrance. This accidental discovery gave rise to his inspiration of making liquor with fermented sorghum seeds.</p>

<h3>Support from Archaeological Findings</h3>

<p>Chemical analyses of ancient organics, absorbed and preserved in pottery jars from the Neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan Province, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey, and fruit was being produced as early as 9000 years ago. Previously the oldest evidence of fermented beverages was dated to 5,400 B.C. and was found at a Neolithic site in Iran. This evidence helps to suggest that the Chinese developed fermented beverages even earlier than people in the Middle East, or perhaps at the same time. Maybe there were some indirect ties between the Middle East and Central Asia at that time in ancient civilization.</p>

<p>In addition, liquids more than 3 000 years old, remarkably preserved inside tightly lidded bronze vessels, were chemically analyzed. These vessels from the city of Anyang, dating to the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties, contained specialized rice and millet liquors. The beverages were flavored with herbs, flowers, and tree resins, and were similar to herbal liquors described in the JiaguWen of Shang Dynasty.</p>

<p>The new discoveries, made by an international, multi-disciplinary team of researchers, provide the first direct chemical evidence for early fermented beverages in ancient Chinese culture, thus broadening our understanding of the key technological and cultural roles that fermented beverages have played in China.</p>

<h3>Excellent liquor brands</h3>

<p>There are many excellent liquor brands. The most famous is Maotai which holds the title of the National Liquor. Wuliangye, made by brewing the five carefully chosen and high-quality grains of sorghum, glutinous rice, rice, wheat, and corn, has the unique style of lasting fragrance, pure and thick flavor, sweet taste in the mouth, refreshing feeling in the throat, all kinds of flavors being harmonious to perfection. Fenjiu is a typical example of liquor with light fragrance. Luzhou, Sichuan, as the cradle of strong aromatic Chinese liquor, has fostered the LuzhouLaojiao of long standing in the history. It has the National Treasured Liquor Vaults of 1573, which are the earliest liquor vaults constructed in 1573, and the ones continuously in use forthe longest time and best preserved in China. Xifeng produced in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province was rated as one of the fourbest liquors in China as early as in 1952. Gujing Gongjiu is produced in Gujing Town, Bozhou City, Anhui. The liquor has become the imperial tribute of all dynasties ever since Cao Cao dedicated Jiuyun Chunjiu, the specialty from his hometown Bozhou and its brewing technique to Emperor Xian of the Han Dynasty, hence the name Gujing Gongjiu.</p>
