    <p>The tradition of having the p, which is cooked with fresh paddy and fruits on Laba Festival, is observed throughout China every year. Millions of Chinese housewives get up early to toil through the day to prepare sundry ingredients to make the treat because a bowl of Laba porridge would not only bring luck and prosperity, but also bring the family members together.</p>

<h3>Origin of the Laba Festival</h3>

<p>La in Chinese means the 12th lunar month and ba means eight. Legends about the origin of this festivity abound. One holds that over 3 000 years ago sacrificial rites called La were held in the twelfth lunar month when people offered up their prey to the gods of heaven and earth. Following the ritual, the participants feasted together on the sacrificial meat in an early expression of the Chinese tradition of communal eating. The Chinese characters for prey and the twelfth month were interchangeable then, and ever since La has been used to refer to both. Since the festival was held on the eighth day of the last month, people later appended the number eight (La in Chinese), giving us the current Laba. The Laba Festival is also referred to as Laji Festival (End-of-Year Sacrifice Festival), another indication of its ancient origins and association with early sacrificial rituals.</p>

<h3>Legend of Laba Porridge</h3>

<p>Laba porridge was first introduced to China in the Song Dynasty about 900 years ago. Buddhism was well accepted in the areas inhabited by the Han people, who believed that Sakyamuni, the  first  Buddha and  founder of the religion,  attained enlightenment on the eighth day of the twelfth month. Legend has it that when Sakyamuni was on his way into the high mountains in his quest for understanding and enlightenment, he grew tired and hungry. Exhausted from days of walking, he passed into unconsciousness by a river in India. A shepherdess found him there and fed him her lunch porridge made with beans and rice. Sakyamuni was thus able to continue his journey. After six years of strict discipline, he finally realized his dream of full enlightenment on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month. Ever since, monks have prepared rice porridge on the eve and held a ceremony the following day, during which they chant sutras and offer porridge to Buddha. Devout Buddhists presented gifts of Laba porridge to the emperor and local officials. The tradition of eating Laba porridge was based in religion though, with the passing of time the food itself has become a popular winter dishes pecially in cold northern China.</p>
