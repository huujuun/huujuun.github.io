    <p>The history of tea in China is long and complex. The Chinese have enjoyed tea for millennia. Scholars hailed the brew as a cure for a variety of ailments; the nobility considered the consumption of good tea as a mark of their status, and the common people simply enjoyed its flavor.</p>

<h3>Legendary Origin of Tea .</h3>

<p>Tea was believed to be discovered by the Chinese Emperor Shennong in 2737 B.C.. It is said that the emperor liked his drinking water boiled clean before he drank it, and that was what his servants usually did. One day, on a trip to a distant region, Shennong and his army stopped to have a rest. Servant began boiling water for him to drink, and a dry leaf from the wild tea bush fell into the water, tinging it brownish. But it was unnoticed and presented to the emperor anyway. The emperor drank it and found it very refreshing. Tea as a drink thus came into being.</p>

<p>While historically the origin of tea as a medicinal herb to keep drinkers awake is unclear, China is considered to have the earliest records of tea drinking, with documents about its history dating back to the first millennium B.C.</p>

<h3>Lu Yu, the Sage of Tea</h3>

<p>Lu Yu，the most prominent and influential person in tea history, was born and lived through the  peak of the Tang Dynasty. Lu Yu devoted his lifetime to research and studies of tea and the essence of his works has delivered the world’s first comprehensive treatise on tea, The Classic of Tea.</p>

<p>The text in The Classic of Tea is just over 7000 Chinese characters. This is because it was written in a traditional classic literary language called Wenyanwen, a highly condensed, refined and poetic styled written Chinese often used by scholars and poets. This little book details rules concerning various aspects of tea, such as growth areas for tea plants, tea ware and skills for processing tea, tea tasting, and quotations from other records. Before The Classic of Tea was published, tea had been mentioned in medical books, short articles, isolated historical records, and poems, but never systematically arranged in a complete book.</p>

<h3>Tea in Different Dynasties</h3>

<p>During the Western Zhou Dynasty, tea was a religious offering. During the Spring and Autumn Period, people ate fresh tea leaves as vegetables. With the popularization of Buddhism from the Three Kingdoms to the Northern and Southern dynasties, the refreshing effect of tea made it a favorite among monks in ZaZen meditation. Tea as a drink prospered during the Tang Dynasty, meanwhile tea houses became popular. Tinted by the cultural style of the Song Dynasty, tea culture at this time was getting more refined and sumptuous. New skills created many different ways for people to enjoy tea. The Ming Dynasty laid the foundation for tea processing, tea types and drinking styles that we have inherited. During the Qing Dynasty folk art entered tea houses, making them popular entertainment centers.</p>

<h3>Chinese Tea on a World Trip</h3>

<p>During the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought tea seeds from Zhejiang Province to Japan. Later, in the Southern Song Dynasty, Zen masters brought tea procedures and tea ware from China to Japan, initiating the Japanese tea ceremony. In the Song Dynasty, Arabic merchants exported tea from Quanzhou, Fujian Province. In the Ming Dynasty, tea was sold to Southeast Asian and South African countries. In 1610 tea went to Europe via Macau in a Dutch merchant ship. Thus tea became an international drink.</p>
