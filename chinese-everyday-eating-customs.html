    <p>As a country that pays great attention to hospitality and courtesy, cuisine culture is deeply rooted in our history. As a visitor or guest at either a Chinese home or restaurant, you will find that table manners are essential and the distinctive courtesies displayed will invariably add to the enjoyment of your meals and keep you in high spirits.</p>

<p>Though customs and food types vary in different regions, it is most common for Chinese families to gather for three meals a day. In some areas and at certain times of the year, laborers may have only two full meals a day, but when possible, they supplement these with up to three smaller ones. The sorts of dishes served at the two or three main meals are pretty much the same. The goal in planning, however, is to provide a number of dishes at each meal, so that, rather than experiencing difference by comparison between one meal and the next, each meal includes, in itself, a satisfying array of elements.</p>

<p>An individual place setting for an everyday meal includes a bowl of fan, a pair of chopsticks, a flat -bottomed soupspoon, and a saucer. The meat and vegetable dishes are laid out all at once in the center of the table, and the diners eat directly from the communal plate using their chopsticks. Soup is also taken from the communal bowl. The saucer is used for bones and shells or as a place to rest a bite taken from a communal plate when it is too large to eat all at once. To eat fan, a diner raises the bowl to the lips and pushes fan into the mouth with chopsticks. This is the easiest way to eat it and show proper enjoyment eating fan from a bowl left siting on the table suggests dissatisfaction with the food. The diner must finish all the fan. To leave even a grain of fan is considered as bad manners, a lack of respect for the labor required to produce it.</p>

<p>In a dramatic reversal of everyday habits, banquets consist solely of special dishes. The meat and vegetables that serve as side dishes at regular meals become the focus, and fan, which is .normally so important that every last grain must be consumed, is relegated to the very end of the banquet and guests need only to pick at fan, indicating their supreme satisfaction. Alcohol is very rarely served at everyday meals, but it plays an important role at banquets.</p>

<p>The banquet begins with a toast by the host. Throughout the banquet, the host displays great solicitousness to the guests. Guests may refuse offers of food or drinks two times or more without being taken at their word, or, of course, without really meaning in their polite refusals. The guest of honor naturally receives the choicest morsels, and is expected to lead the way when necessary. At the end of the banquet, when the guest of honor feels that everyone appears to have had their fill of alcohol or ceremonial final cup of tea, he should rise from the seat.</p>
