    <p>Baozi, a steamed filled bun, is such a common food in China that most of us take it for granted and don’t particularly look out for it when dining in restaurants. In some parts of southern China, for example, Shanghai, a steamed bun, either with stuffing or not, is still called “mantou”. But in the north, people only call a stuffed bun baozi.</p>

<h3>Go Believe (Goubuli) Baozi</h3>

<p>The Goubuli brand first appeared in 1858 and there are various explanations for the brand. The most popular one has it that a poor village boy nicknamed Gouzi (puppy) went to Tianjin and apprenticed at a food shop at the age of 14. Years later he started his own business of baozi. Each baozi had 15 wrinkles and looked like a chrysanthemum. Soft and delicious, his baozi soon attracted numerous customers, Gouzi became so busy at the shop and had no time to speak with customers, who complained Gouzi sells baozi but does not speak to people”. The saying was then shortened to goubuli, which means Gouzi does not speak to people. Goubuli baozi was awarded the title Famous Chinese Snack by the China Cuisine Association in 1997. In 2008, it adopted an English name, Go Believe, which sounds like its bizarre Chinese name Goubuli.</p>

<h3>Jiasan Guantang Bao</h3>

<p>Jiasan Guantang Bao is a variation from a Muslim style restaurant in Xi’an. No one makes better Guantang Bao than thechefs of Jiasan Restaurant. Each batch is devoured by eager customers within minutes.  Good Guantang Bao should arrive completely intact when they are served, with no cracks on the surface. Guantang Bao is distinguished from other baozi by its paper-thin wrapper and soupy stuffing. Although the skin is thin,it should not break or stick to the bottom of the container. The appropriate way to eat Guantang Bao is to hold it on a spoon, pierce it with a chopstick to let the soup out, then suck the soup before popping the baozi into your mouth.</p>

<h3>Shengjian Mantou</h3>

<p>Shengian Mantou is a type of small, pan-fried baozi which is a specialty of Shanghai.  The name of Shengian Mantou, comes from its method of cooking. Shengjian is made from semi-leavened dough, wrapped with pork and gelatin fillings. An oiled shallow flat pan, is used in making Shengjian. Typical commercial pans are more than a meter in diameter. Water is sprayed on baozi during cooking to ensure the top (which is not in contact with the pan or the oil) is properly cooked. After frying, the bottom of baozi becomes crunchy, and the gelatin melts into soup. Chopped green onion and sesame are sprinkled on baozi during the cooking process. This combination gives Shengjian its unique flavor.</p>

<h3>Chashao Bao .</h3>

<p>Chashao Bao is a Cantonese style baozi, is filled with barbecue- flavored charsiu pork. It is served as a type of dim sum during yum cha (drink tea). Although visually similar to other types of baozi, the dough of Chashao Bao is unique since it makes use of both yeast and baking powder in leavening. This .unique mix of leavening gives the dough baau a soft, fluffy, and almost cake-like texture. Indeed the texture of the dough is so appealing that many other types of baozi are made using Chashao Bao dough.</p>
