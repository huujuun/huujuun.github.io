    <p>The legendary emperor Shennong claimed in The Divine Farmer’s Herb-Root Classic that tea infusions were useful for treating negative conditions including tumors, abscesses, bladder ailments, and lethargy. The vast majority of studies about tea and health have been of green tea; however, some studies have been made of the other types of tea, such as black, oolong, and Pu’er tea.</p>

<h3>Green Tea and Health</h3>

<p>Green tea has the most medical value and the least caffeine content of all Chinese tea. Green tea is the least processed and thus provides the most antioxidant polyphenols, notably a catechin called epigallocatechin gallate(EGCG), which is believed to be responsible for most of the health benefits linked to green tea. With the presence of polyphenols, the beverage is said to combat harmful free radicals and help keep the body free from diseases. In this regard, green tea helps maintain the overall well-being of the body. Over the centuries, more health claims are made on account of Chinese green tea. One of these benefits is preventing cancer. In addition, green tea can increase the blood flow throughout the body. As a result, drinking green tea helps strengthen the blood vessels that provide oxygen and valuable nutrients to the heart and brain. It has been shown that men who drink Chinese green tea have 75 percent less possibility of having a stroke than those who don’t drink this tea.</p>

<h3>Black Tea Deserves Credit</h3>

<p>Since the fermentation process of black tea converts EGCG into other compounds, researchers assume black tea may have less health benefits than green tea. However, recent studies indicate the compounds contained in black tea - theaflavins and thearubigins - do more than contribute to its deep color and distinctive flavor. They also provide health benefits originally owed solely to green tea. In fact, black tea contains more complex flavonoids than  green tea ,  specifically thearubigins and theaflavins, which are powerful antioxidants. While green tea continues to steal the health limelight, black tea deserves center stage right along with it.</p>

<h3>Health Benefits of Pu'er Tea</h3>

<p>\Accounts on the health benefits and medical use of Pu’ er tea have been documented in various ancient scripts and famous books throughout Chinese history. Pu’ er tea is strongly believed to have a wide range of health benefits from antiaging, prevention of heart disease and cancer, diabetic control, removal of toxins, to curing dysentery, inflammation, aiding digestion  and  weight  loss, improving the eyesight ,  blood circulation, and reviving those who are overly intoxicated with alcohol. In many traditional Chinese restaurants, especially those serving dim sum, Pu’er tea is the customary drink provided. Its ability to break down oily, fatty food and aid digestion makes it an ideal drink to have alongside delicious Chinese dishes that are often high in fat. After a heavy meal, drinking Pu’er tea is said to help clean the intestines and the stomach.</p>

<h3>Scientifically-Supported Health Myths from Oolong Tea</h3>

<p>A research of the specialists from the Department of Nutrition, University of Tokushima and the Suntory Research Center results in finding scientific evidences that oolong tea can increase metabolic rate in men and energy metabolism in women. Also, Japanese scientists report that drinking 3-4 cups of oolong tea a day can assist in fighting with eczema. The researches from the University of California demonstrate that oolong tea is an excellent antioxidant, which can assist in fighting with such diseases as arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s disease ,and many other problems connected with aging.</p>
