<meta name="description" content="Northerners prefer to use red beans, dates, lotus seeds, dried pulp, walnuts, pine nuts, and other dried fruits in their porridge; southerners like a salty porridge prepared with soybeans, peanuts, broad beans, taro, water chestnuts, walnuts, vegetables, and diced meat. Controlling the heat is of great importance in making Laba porridge. At the start, the flame must be high, but the fire is then turned down to let the porridge simmer until it begins to emit a very delicious smell. The process is time-consuming but not complicated. Laba porridge is a very nourishing and healthful food because it contains amino acids, protein, vitamins, and other nutrition people need. Cooked nuts and dried fruit are good for soothing nerves, nourishing one’s heart and vitality, and strengthening the spleen. Perhaps that is why it is also called “Babao (Eight Treasures) Porridge”. In his encyclopedic classic of herbal medicine Bencao Gangmu, the eminent Ming Dynasty physician Li Shizhen states that rice porridge increases the life force, produces saliva, nourishes the spleen and stomach, and resolves sweating due to weak constitution at health." />

<p>Jan. 26, 2007,  More than 3000 Beijingers and visitors enjoyed a bowl of hot porridge served by monks at the Yonghe Lamasery in Beijing to observe China’s traditional porridge serving day. Twenty-four giant caldrons of porridge which weighed 385 kilograms and were made from 29 ingredients were served. The ancient Yonghe Lamasery used to serve porridge to the royal family, as well as to Buddhists and poor people. Nowadays, porridge served by the temple is considered as a blessing from Buddha. Monks at the Yonghe Lamasery spent five days on preparing the porridge mixture which took nine hours and 20 monks to cook.</p>
