<h3>Liangcha</h3>

<p>Liangcha is a kind of tea brew made from purely Chinese medicinal herbs in Guangdong, China. It usually tastes bitter or lightly sweet and its color is typically black or dark brown, depending on what kinds of herbs are used. Liangcha is known for being able to remove the spiritual heat and dampness from one’s body to retain a healthy balance of the basic elements and fluids in the body. Liangcha chain stores such as Hong Fook Tong, Hui Lau Shan, Hoi Tin Tong and Health Works have flourished in Hong Kong. Across the border, Guangzhou’s Wang Laoji and Wong Chun Loong are the most famous brands. Others include Foshan based Xu Qixiu and Guangzhou-based Runxin Tang. Several years ago, some manufacturers began to produce the traditional Liangcha on modern production lines in cans or softbacks for the convenience of customers. Sales of Liangcha hit 4million tons in 2006, overtaking Coca-Cola as No, 1 soft drink in China by sales volume. In the same year, Liangcha won approval from the State Council to be named as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage, in which a total of 18 brands from 21 Liangcha companies and 54 secret recipes are now under the World Cultural Heritage Protection Convention and China’s own preservation laws.</p>

<h3>Bubble Tea</h3>

<p>Bubble tea originated in Taiwan in the 1980s. After it was brought to non-Asian areas, it was given the name bubble tea. The word bubble refers to bubbling, the process by which certain types of bubble tea are made. To efficiently and homogenously mix various ingredients, drink makers often shake the tea up as bartenders do with cocktails. Thus prepared, a layer of bubbles forms on the surface. The Chinese term for this drink would be literally translated pearl milk tea. Since the most notable difference between bubble tea and other teas is the black gummy pearl balls made of tapioca at the bottom of the drink, some mistakenly assume that the bubble” in bubble tea” refers to these pear is, hence the name pearl milk tea”. As this drink becomes more popular, variations have been created: initially iced versions with a hint of peach or plum flavoring and more fruit flavors having been added later. Alternatives to tapioca balls in general are egg pudding, pieces of aloe, coconut jelly, or konjac jelly.</p>

<h3>Bottled Tea Drinks</h3>

<p>Although faced with competition from other brands such as Uni-President , Wahaha, Suntory, Nestle , Master Kong continues to maintain its strong leading position in China ‘s tea drink market.  In the year of 2009, Master Kong’s tea series commenced a nationwide promotional lucky draw activity of one more bottle, leading the growth of the overall tea drink market. Coca-Cola, with 12% of the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage market in mainland China, was active in fighting back. It bought a beverage factory in Guangdong and  produced health drinks through its Health Works brand, inviting singer and actor Jacky Cheung Hok-yau to be a spokesman. It also launched a research center for traditional Chinese medicine in Beijing to develop beverages using Chinese herbal ingredients and formulas.</p>
