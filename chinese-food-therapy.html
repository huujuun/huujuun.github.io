    <p>The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine (also known as Neiing), written around 300 B.C., was most important in forming the basis of Chinese food therapy. During the Zhou Dynasty, food therapy was established as a special field. But it was not until the Tang Dynasty that food therapy became popular and the classic books on the subject were published.</p>

<h3>Chinese Medicated Diet</h3>

<p>When the Chinese discovered farming and agriculture in the early days, they discovered the medicinal properties of food. Since then, food has been studied and analyzed for its medicinal effects on people. Chinese medicated diet is not a simple combination of food and Chinese herbs, but a special highly-finished diet made from Chinese herbs, food, and condiments under the theoretical guidance of diet preparation, which is based on differentiation of symptoms and signs of traditional Chinese medicine. It has not only the efficiency of medicine but also the delicacy of food, and can be used to prevent and cure diseases, build up one’s health, and prolong one’s life. Most therapeutic food are eaten as meals or with meals and repeated for days or sometimes weeks until the body has enough nutrition to repair itself. After recovery, repeating the recipe at regular intervals is recommended for maintenance purposes. In the Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao, a well-known doctor, who died at the age of 101, once said that when a person was sick, the doctor should first regulate his or her diet and lifestyle. In most cases, these changes alone are enough to bring about a cure over time. In the Ming Dynasty, Li Shizhen collected and recorded many medicated diet prescriptions, dozens of which were about medicated porridge alone.</p>

<h3>Eat According to the Season</h3>

<p>Eating to counter the seasonal excesses or evils is a very effective way in staying well. In spring, it is the season dominated by wind. When the pores of your skin dilate due to the warmer temperatures after the cold winter, it is easier for wind-evil to enter the body. So it is important to eat food that can eliminate excessive wind” in the body during spring. In summer, when heat combines with dampness, it results in abdominal pains, vomiting, and intestinal spasms. Cooling yin foods will help, while overly hot yang foods should be avoided. Iced drinks are cool in terms of temperature, but not cool in nature. They can damage the spleen and stomach, causing more health problems. In autumn, dryness dominates and can easily injure the lungs. More nourishing yin foods should be taken to promote body fluid and soothe the lungs. In winter, cold is a yin-evil, which dominates and consumes the body’s yang energy. To prevent the attack of cold, plenty of warming yang foods and slightly fatty foods should be included in the diet.</p>

<h3>Eat According to Age and Needs</h3>

<p>To stay healthy, people should eat according to age and physical needs. Young children whose bodies are developing healthy bones and muscles need a diet rich in protein and calcium. They are highly active and should eat regularly to maintain their energy levels. Teens need a good quantity of well- balanced diet with lots of calories and nutrients as they develop toward maturity. Older people whose digestive systems are weakening and who are less physically active should eat less and have foods easier to digest. Professional people in certain occupational fields, such as athletes or construction workers, should eat more , especially carbohydrates to maintain their energy. People whose profession requires them to think more can nourish their brain with a protein-rich diet.</p>
