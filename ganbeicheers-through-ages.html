    <p>In China, the life of every person should have pauses for JiuXi (literally liquor drinking banquets). When someone builds a new house, marries, starts a business, makes a fortune, or celebrates birthday, he should invite people in for a drink. “If we are good friends, then drink up; if not, then just take a sip” is a common phrase exchanged during gatherings.</p>

<h3>Versatile Traditional Ganbei Culture</h3>

<p>The symbolic serving and drinking of liquor on various ccasions and in different places can convey many meanings. It can express either joy or sorrow. In China, there is a saying that a thousand cups of liquor is not too much when bosom friends meet together”, which indicates the happiness between two confidants; whereas a verse by Li Bai, a noted poet in the Tang Dynasty says,  “releasing melancholy with liquor, but adding more” , suggests a touch of sadness.</p>

<p>In ancient times, before a battle, a general would feast his soldiers with liquor and meat. If they won the battle, they would be rewarded with good liquor. If a warrior fell in the battle, his fellows would scatter liquor on the ground as part of a memorial ceremony. Liquor is intimately connected with most Chinese men of letters. There are many famous Chinese poets and artists who craft their masterpieces after getting “drunk” .</p>

<p>Under the marriage tradition of Daur nationality in China, after the bride’s relatives accompany the bride to the bridegroom’s home, the bridegroom’s parents should entertain the bride’s relatives with two cups of liquor, which is named Welcome Drink”. The relatives should drink it up in order to show they have been united as one family. In the Nu nationality area in Yunnan Province, all the families of the village should come to condole with liquor when someone is dead. The wizard pours some liquor into the dead person’s mouth, while all the people on the spot have a cup of liquor, which is named “Farewell Drink”.</p>

<h3>Protocol of Ganbei at Dinner Table</h3>

<p>When drinking liquor at table, both the host and the guests are expected to observe certain rules of etiquette and behavior. Atypical Jiu Xi will involve 8 12 people seated around a large roundtable, in a private room with numerous dishes. At least two glasses are placed in front of each person: a large one for beer and a shot glass for baijiu. There is a whole protocol in Ganbei. The glass should be full of liquor, else it is thought that due respect is lacking. When making a Ganbei, everyone is required to stand and lightly touch each other’ s cup, ensuring that the junior ‘s cup is held lower than that of his superior. The cup should be emptied and inverted to show that no liquor remains.</p>

<p>The host will start and propose a Ganbei with baijiu, then the guest; after that the second host would make a Ganbei, and so on. Protocol will then allow a free-for -all, where everyone makes Ganbei in no specific order. In addition, there are fines (i.e. one has to drink one shot for being late) and many unwritten rules. If someone tries not to drink, he will have to drink double. If one volunteers to drink for a helpless associate, he will have to drink his friend’s shot and then his own. It is customary to be under attack from the whole table; especially if one is the highest-ranking of the group. The usual procedure is that each person at, say, a table of ten, rises to drink with him, each in turn. Do the math: after ten rounds they each have one shot, he will have ten.</p>
