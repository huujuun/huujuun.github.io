    <h3>Five Elements in the Body</h3>

<p>Like the concept of yin and yang, the Five Elements Theory is at the cornerstone of Chinese culture. In traditional Chinese philosophy, natural phenomena can be categorized into five elements (pronounced Wuxing in Chinese): wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. However, these elements are not static; they are constantly moving and changing. Once the Chinese identified the five elements, they set about categorizing all phenomena with in the five categories. Everything, from a river to sounds, even to the organs in human bodies, can be described in terms of the five elements. How things are characterized depends on their individual qualities. For example, earth is associated with growth and nourishment, so the spleen, which monitors the blood digesting debris and producing antibodies when necessary is categorized as an earth element. According to the Chinese belief , each element acts upon two others, either giving birth to it or .controlling it. For example, wood gives birth to fire and controls or suppresses earth. Similarly, fire gives birth to earth and controls metal. For example, a plant (wood) grows when it is .given water. When burnt, wood gives birth to fire, and the burnt ashes subsequently return to the earth.</p>

<p>In human body, all five elements are represented because they correspond to the five major organs: kidneys, liver, heart, stomach and lungs. Usually one is stronger than the others, and one is slightly deficient. One of the most important ways to create balance in the body is to choose to eat more foods, which strengthen and replenish the elements in which we are deficient.</p>

<h3>Eat Five Elements</h3>

<p>As for diet, there is a useful relationship between the colors of food, the five elements, and corresponding body systems. Green foods nourish the liver; yellow and orange foods nourish the spleen and stomach; red foods nourish the heart; white foods nourish the lungs; black or dark blue foods nourish the kidneys. So, a person with weak digestion should include plenty of yellow and orange foods, such as sweet potatoes and winter squashes, as they bear the colors corresponding to the earth element or the spleen organ. One with heart weakness would do well by taking more red foods, such as tomatoes and hawthorn berries, as red corresponds to the fire element and the heart organ. Chinese herbalists believe that they need to know the state of the five elements in their patients to give them proper treatment. A deficiency or an excess of an element can lead to illness. It is self- explanatory to say that practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine rely on the Five Elements Theory” to explain the relationships between body organs and tissues, as well as between the body and the outside environment.</p>

<h3>food and Five Elements</h3>

<p>Water-associated foods have a softening effect and promote moisture and poise of the body. They benefit thin, dry, and nervous people most. Foods like chicken, liver, wheat, greens, and citrus fruits are dominated by wood. These foods which can obstruct movement and function as astringents benefit moody and erratic people. Fire-dominated foods can dry fluids, so they are most beneficial to slow, overweight, and aggressive people. Earth-natured foods can slow down acute symptoms and neutralize toxins, and they are fitting for nervous,weak people. Metal-classified foods have a dispersing effect that could promote energy circulation. They do good to sluggish, damp, lethargic, and cold people. Each type of food will have one dominant element. For instance, the fire element plays a major role in chili pepper.</p>
