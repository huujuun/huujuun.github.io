    <p>The rock and roll singer from Bejing, Cui Jian, once said in one of his songs: “It’s not that I don’t understand; it’s just that the world is changing too fast”. The speed with which Beijing is becoming internationalized is really startling.</p>

<p><img src="./imgs/2021042307291871.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At least, in terms of the city architecture, Beijing is already an international city. One architect said that Beijing is becoming a secondhand Hong Kong. To me, Beijing seems even more like Hong Kong than Hong Kong itself. Some of the world’s foremost architects come here so they can let their imagination run wild. The National Grand Theater looks like a giant glass egg, and the national stadium looks like a big bird’s nest. You can’t say these daring designs are in keeping with the historic Beijing; they’d look just as much in place in New York City.</p>

<p>That’s not hard to understand. Many countries create new and unorthodox architectural Mega Phenomena when their economies are just starting to take off. During the 19th century, the British built the Crystal Palace and, during the 20th century, the Americans built the Empire State Building. They wanted to make it known to everybody they weren’t just economic superpowers but would also become global cultural centers.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I feel the Chinese have started copying western things too slavishly and don’t cherish their own culture enough. One newspaper commented that 70% of new buildings in Beijing were named after places in America or Europe. Many foreign tourists come to Beijing hoping to see a historic city with an Eastern flavor, but what they find is a rapidly developing modern city.</p>

<p>Maybe you don’t understand the old houses look very attractive, but they are not very suitable places to live. A photographer, who was set on living in Beijing’s siheyuan, soon found there was no running water, no decent kitchen and nowhere to park a car. In the end, he moved into a new apartment building with all the modern facilities.
The Hutong is beautiful, but they don’t provide the amenities which people of today expect. My impression is that the city is looking to the future and trying to keep up with the tides of global change, but she has no time to preserve her history.</p>

<p>It’s not as serious as you make it out to be. There are still many cultural attractions in Beijing, just as before, and a new vitality has poured into a few of the old streets. The siheyuan in the area of Shichahai, where the most beautiful old architecture is located, have been converted into European style bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>In this way, the Chinese balance yin and yang and harmonize the modern and traditional of East and West. They have made Beijing, a historic Eastern city and an international landmark as well.</p>
