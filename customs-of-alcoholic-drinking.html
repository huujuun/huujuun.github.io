    <p>In ancient China, alcohol was regarded as a sacred liquid and used as a sacrificial offering to the Heaven and the Earth or ancestors. After the Zhou Dynasty, alcohol was deemed as one of the nine rites, and every dynasty put much emphasis on alcohol administration. Later， along with the development of fermentation and brewery, alcohol became ordinary drink. Thus, many customs concerning alcohol have formed and evolved.</p>

<h3>Drinking Etiquette in History</h3>

<p>The customs and rules of alcoholic drinking were greatly influenced by doctrine of Confucianism, which focused on the moralities of drinking alcoholic beverages. First appearing in The Book of History and The Book of Songs, moralities of drinking alcoholic beverages meant that drinkers should follow social moralities and shouldn’t do as Emperor Zhou did - violation of humanism and indulgence in drinking. The Book of History: Forbidden-Drink Document chiefly represented the Confucian morality of drinking alcohols: there was no drinking except for the ceremony of paying esteem and worship to gods, no or rare drinking in order to save grains except for the moment you didn’t feel well, no big-group drinking, and no indulgence in drinking.</p>

<p>When Yuan Hongdao, an official of the Ming Dynasty, saw some drunkards not follow etiquette of drinking alcohol, he abstracted a great deal from the ancient books about the rules that drinkers should follow and wrote a book, Regulations of Drinking Alcoholic Beverages, specially focusing on how to behave while drinking. Although it was written particularly for those who played finger-guessing games, it was also significant to common drinkers. There were four stages of drinking etiquette in ancient China: esteem, memorial ceremony, tasting, and drinking-up. That is to say, the drinker should first pay esteem by kneeling down, then pour a bit of alcohol down to the ground to thank for the kindness of the earth that provides us with grains and foods, after that, sip to taste it and express his appreciation in. order to make the host delightful, and at last take up the cup to drink it down.</p>

<h3>Drinking Alcohol on Auspicious Moments</h3>

<p>Nearly all important occasions are celebrated with alcohol. Chinese New Year, which is a favorite time for family reunions, is probably one of the most significant occasions when rejoicing is expressed by social drinking. During the Double Ninth Festival, people drink chrysanthemum wine to ward off evil and to wish their elders good health and longevity. Showing-Affection to-Each-Other Drink is one procedure of the traditional Chinese wedding ceremony. It is also called Matching Two Gourd Ladles Together “which meant getting married in ancient China. During the Song Dynasty, the custom was rather popular. Two cups containing alcoholic drink were tied and linked together with colorful silk lace, in the mid of which there was a colorful silk flower. The couple took one cup each and drank each ethnic group in China holds its own feature in alcohol.</p>

<h3>Drinking Customs of Ethnic in China</h3>

<p>Each ethnic group in China holds its own feature in alcohol. Drinking customs except that people who believe in Islamism generally don’t have alcoholic beverages. The Korean nationality’s Year Feast Drink” is mainly made of rice, together with some Chinese medicine herbs. It is similar to “Tusu Alcoholic Drink”, but different from it in compositions of Chinese medicine herbs. The Hani nationality, living around Yuanjiang’s reach of Yunnan Province, holds a yearly ceremony with a rich Newly-Harvested Grain Alcoholic Drink” feast according to the traditional customs. Newly-Harvested Grain Alcoholic Drink” is actually made in such a way: Each family cuts a bunch of would-be ripe grain, and then hangs it on the upper part of the rear wall of the house to ask for the family god’s blessings and guard. Over a hundred grains of the rice or other corns are taken down, with some fried into puffed grains and some not; then they are soaked into a pot full of alcoholic drink. A lucky date is chosen to drink it, all the family members having several sips of the “Newly-Harvested Grain Alcoholic Drink” and enjoying the dinner to their hearts’ content.</p>
