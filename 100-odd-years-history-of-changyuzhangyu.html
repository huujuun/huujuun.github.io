    <p>In recent years, wine has gained popularity as more people begin to value health when choosing liquor products. Wine provides the body with energy, with substances that aid digestion and with small amounts of minerals and vitamins. Moderate consumption of red wine on a regular basis can also stimulate the appetite，boost the immune system， protect against heart disease，and block cancer formation.</p>

<h3>Founder of Changyu - Zhang Bishi</h3>

<p>In 1871, Mr. Zhang Bishi was invited by a Dutch friend to the French embassy in Jakarta for a party. The French consulate hosted a very formal high-class event where premium French wines were served. The bouquet and taste of these French wines impressed Mr. Bishi immensely.</p>

<p>Li Hongzhang assisted Mr. Zhang Bishi in gaining the Chinese business license and in fact it was Mr. Li’s personal sealon the original business license of Changyu Winery. Li Hongzhang took Changyu Winery as a symbol of his initiative known a Westernization Movement”, established to encourage Chinese businessmen to begin new industry and to compete internationally. The benefits afforded Changyu Winery in their business license stated Changyu enjoyed 3 years of free tax, and Chinese o1foreign companies in Liaoning, Hebei and Shandong provinces could not be involved in the wine industry for the first 15 years of Changyu’s license.  Changyu Winery did not disappoint LHongzhang, The wine it produced was not only of high quality wine, but quickly became popular and was under quite high demand. “Why don’t I set up a winery?” This idea grew in his mind until he formed a plan, and finally he established Changyu Winery in 1892.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Bishi was active in donating money to the national revolution led by Sun Yet-sun. In 1912 when Mr. Sun Yet sun visited Changyu Winery and tasted Changyu wine, he inscribed the characters Pin Zhong Li Quan. Mr. Zhang Xueliang gave Changyu Winery the inscription of Gui Dun Yi Mou. Gui Dun means Bai Gui and Yi Dun who were two famous businessmen in the Spring-Autumn Period of Chinese history. Zhang Xueliang took this to mean that Changyu Winery had special company management and experience.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Brand</h3>

<p>The first batch of wine was made in 1896， but Changyu Winery did not launch it at once. Instead, they put the wines in the cellar for 18 years. In 1914， these wines were tested and declared excellent with the right maturation and color. After this, Changyu Winery applied for trademark and released the wines tothe market. Changyu Winery knew the importance of establishing its own brand and did a lot of advertisement for Changyu wine. Billboards were put up at ports, bus and train stations. Dishware with the name of the winery was served to hotels and restaurants. At festivals, big trucks would carry big barrels to parade and give small bottles of wine to the audience as gift. Premier Zhou Enlai used to pay a lot of attention to Changyu wine. In 1954, Premier Zhou chose Maotai and Changyu wine to be sent to Geneva.</p>

<p>ln 2001, Changyu entered into a joint venture with the Castel Group, the largest grower and distributor of wine in France and the second largest beverage distributor in the world. Wine chateaus are traditional tourist resorts in European and North and South American countries. With 100-odd years’ history of winemaking, Changyu launched China’s first tourist route with a wine culture theme, the Chateau Changyu-Castel. Changyu Group has been ranked as the 10th largest winery in the world in2008. This is the first time that an Asian winery has entered the top 10 global wineries.</p>

<h3>the trademark of Jiebaina and Changyu</h3>

<p>In 2008, the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce announced that Changyu Wine Company is the owner of the trademark Jiebaina. This brought an end to the six-year dispute about the intellectual property rights of Jiebaina. However, other wine companies, including Great Wall, Weilong Grape Wine, and Dynasty Winery, handed in a joint application, asking the administration to withdraw the trademark license. Their reason was that Jiebaina was a variety of grape and a common name for grape products. Therefore, Changyu should not have the exclusive right for it. Changyu retorted that Jiebaina was an original brand of the company and its statement was supported by departments such as the Sub-council of Grape and Wine of the Chinese Society for Horticultural Science, and the Chinese Society for Viticulture. According to these departments, Jiebaina was not included in the formal names of existing varieties of grapes.</p>
