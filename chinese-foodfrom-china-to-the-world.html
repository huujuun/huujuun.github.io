    <p>Wherever Chinese people appear, Chinese restaurants will be opened. Survey data indicate that more than half of the overseas Chinese work in the catering industry or related food industries. In Britain, Germany, and Netherlands, this percentage is even higher, reaching about 80 percent. To some degree, the ups and downs of Chinese restaurants reflect the living conditions of overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>A primary way for overseas Chinese to obtain a strong foothold in a foreign country is by opening a restaurant. Indeed, most first-generation overseas Chinese began their adventures by opening restaurants. It seemed that this was their only employment choice. Today it is difficult to tell when and where the first Chinese restaurant was opened outside China. According to some documents, the first Chinese restaurant in the U.S. a Cantonese Chinese restaurant – opened in San Francisco in1849. Currently the oldest existing Chinese restaurant in America is the Imperial Dynasty Restaurant located in Hanford, California. Jiang Rong, a railway worker from China’s Guangdong Province, opened it in 1883. Today his fourth generation family members are still operating the restaurant. In 1914, the first Chinese restaurant in France, the China Restaurant, opened.</p>

<p>Chinese restaurants have been around for a long time, but their booming has begun only over the past 20 years. In the1980s, the Chinese mainland was experiencing the initial stages of its reform and opening up. Chinese people had opportunities to go abroad and foreigners also had the chance to visit China. All these factors prompted Chinese entrepreneurs to establish restaurants in many foreign countries, and business boomed. In an interview with the Globe, Chief of the Washington Chinese Restaurant Association, recalled, In 1980 I opened an authentic Chinese restaurant, but we had no specific menu. The chefs just prepared some Jiangsu and Zhejiang dishes. Each time the restaurant opened, customers would rush in. Since then,  Chinese  restaurants featuring different dishes have begun to emerge across America.</p>

<p>According to a 2006 survey, the UK had nearly 9000 Chinese restaurants, about a quarter of all the country’s restaurants; Netherlands had more than 2200, accounting for 28percent of all the restaurants, where 85 percent of Chinese Dutchmen were working; Chinese restaurants and fast food surpassed 7000 in Germany, and 80 percent of the Chinese Germans took jobs in the catering trade. However, with an increasing number of Chinese restaurants taking root overseas and fierce competition from the counterparts, Chinese restaurants abroad are being confronted with challenges.</p>
