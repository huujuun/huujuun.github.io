    <p>Alcoholic Drinks and Healthcare</p>

<p>Over the last decade there has been quite a shift in public opinion concerning the health effects of alcohol. Fuelled by TV programs and numerous reports in the press, most people now believe that alcohol  benefits health when drunk in moderation, which means an average of no more than one drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men.</p>

<h3>Beer and Health</h3>

<p>Studies prove that double- or triple fermentation beer is good for health, particularly given the vitamin B present in the yeast. Its beneficial effects are linked to its dietary, diuretic, and sedative properties. Though beer has the reputation of causing weight gain, its calorific value is inferior to that of apple juice or wine. Moreover, thanks to the amino acids, vitamin B, and iron it contains, beer is an energizing beverage recommended for anaemic and convalescent persons, as well as those who have lost a lot of weight. The diuretic action of beer is due to the hops resin, which stimulates the kidneys, thereby contributing to the elimination not only of excess water in the body, but also of wastes and toxins. The sedative action of the hops joined with the calorific effect of the alcohol make beer a light and pleasant sleep-inducing beverage.</p>

<h3>Health Benefits of Red Wine</h3>

<p>Experts say the health benefits of wine, especially red wine, may have gotten the most attention in recent years because of the popularity of the so-called “French Paradox’ “. The paradox refers to a study published several years ago, suggesting that the French population’s passion for wine may be responsible for keeping their heart disease rates low despite their love of rich, fatty foods. Since then, researchers have been trying to tease out what exactly in the wine seems to protect against heart disease and stroke, Studies have suggested that it may lie in the antioxidant-rich skins of the grapes used to make wine, but others have shown that antioxidants have little effect on heart health. Resveratrol might be another key ingredient in red wine that helps prevent damage to blood vessels, reduces “bad” cholesterol, and prevents blood clots. However, most research on resveratrol has been conducted on animals, not people.</p>

<h3>Chinese Medicated Liquor</h3>

<pre><code>  Since liquor itself has the effect for stimulating blood circulation and relaxing muscles and joints, it can be used to treat general asthenia, rheumatic pain, and traumatic injury. In addition, liquor is a kind of good solvent, which may extract a higher proportion of ingredients from medical material. Chinese people like to use precious medical material to make medicated liquor, which can reinforce body fluid and nourish blood. Though medicated liquor is good for human body, it cannot be drunk superfluously. A frequency of 2 or 3 times a day with each dosage measuring 10 ml to 50 ml is proper for people.

<h3>Cautions</h3>

<p>Too much of a good thing is definitely a bad thing when it comes to alcohol. Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are big causes of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Heavy drinkers are at increased risk for certain types of cancer, and drinking is also associated with an increased risk of accidental death and mental health problems such as depression. There are certain people who should not drink- even in moderation- because they are more likely to develop alcohol-related complications. These groups include pregnant women, people who take medications that may interact with alcohol, and people who have medical conditions such as ulcers or liver conditions that might worsen with alcohol use.</p>

<h3>Chinese Food about Acohol</h3>

<p>There are a vast number of wonderful recipes which use some form of alcohol as an ingredient to achieve a desired chemical reaction in a dish. Some alcoholic beverages can help break down tough fibers via marinades. Other dishes use alcoholic content to provide entertainment, such as flambés and flaming dishes. One popular alcohol-flavored dish is Drunken Chicken. Shaoxing Drunken Chicken is cooked and marinated exclusively in historic Shaoxing Huangjiu to create a deep taste. Jiuniang is a sweet, soup-like drink made from fermented glutinous rice and yeast. Although Jiuniang is similar to unfiltered rice liquor in that it is mildly alcoholic, it contains whole rice grains and is often made with sweet Osman thus flowers. When made so, it is called Guihua Jiuniang. Jiuniang can also be served together with small unfilled tangyuan. When served in sucha manner it is called Jiuniang Tangyuan.</p>
