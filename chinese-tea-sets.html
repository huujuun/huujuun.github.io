    <p>Chinese tea sets vary in material, shape, technology, and naming due to diversified drinking habits and customs indifferent historical periods, different areas, and different nationalities. The Chinese believe that to make an excellent tea it is important to blend harmoniously with the material and color of the ware. Fine tea sets can please the eye and promote the enjoyment of tea.</p>

<h3>Tea Sets Made of Diverse Materials</h3>

<p>Tea sets in China are made of various materials, including metal, porcelain, pottery, purple clay, lacquer, wood, bamboo, and glass. Tea sets made of metal were served for the noble, and civilians commonly used porcelain ware and earthenware in the Tang Dynasty. In the Song Dynasty glazed tea sets of various colors were the fashion, while porcelain tea sets predominated in the Yuan Dynasty.</p>

<p>Metal tea sets appeared earliest and existed for a long period of time in Chinese people’s lives. However, the original tea flavors could be easily destroyed in metal wares. As a result, metal tea sets gradually disappeared to give way to the porcelain and pottery wares.</p>

<p>Bamboo tea sets in Sichuan Province are made up of inner and outer bodies. The inner bodies are mostly porcelain and pottery tea sets, based on which outer bamboo bodies are made to protect and perfect the inner ones. Meanwhile, the tea sets will be not too hot to touch with the overcoat. In modern times, glass utensils are warmly welcomed because of their transparent texture and dazzling luster. Making tea in a glass cup, you can clearly see the real color of the brew and the softness of the tea leaves. But glass tea cups break easily, and they are often too hot to touch. .</p>

<h3>Yixing Purple Clay Tea Sets</h3>

<p>Yixing tea sets possess an astonishing history dating back to the Ming Dynasty when purple clay found near the Yangtze River was first used by potters to craft these beautiful little stoneware vessels. These tea sets are handmade individually. No chemicals or glazes are added to the clay during its production. Since they are not glazed, the clay pots absorb some of the tea brew. Over time, a layer of tea sediment forms, and with subsequent use one is brewing tea within tea. Tea connoisseurs also insist that each Yixing tea set should be dedicated to only one kind of tea.</p>

<p>To make tea for your own enjoyment, all you need is just a Yixing teapot, but to really enjoy the full relaxation of sipping tea with your guests, it helps to have a full tea set which contains the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Yíxing teapot&lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li><p>A tray to trap the wasted tea water</p></li>
<li>Cups</li>
<li>A tea tool kit which contains the following: a digger, a funnel, a needle, a shuffle, a tong and a vase.</li>
<li>A brush to wipe the wasted tea all over the tray to create an even tea stains. Over time, the tray will be covered with beautiful stain patterns.</li>
<li>A sieve – even if you pour tea from the pot, some tealeaf bits will still be poured out, so a sieve will help to filter out the loose bits during pouring.</li>
<li>A tea set wouldn't be completed without arranging a clay animal or two. They are for decoration and good luck. Pour your leftover tea on top of the animals to create some beautiful stain patterns over many uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Different Tea Sets with Different Teas</h3>

<p>Chinese people use different kinds of tea sets with different kinds of teas. Green tea goes with white porcelain or celadon without a cover while scented tea with celadon or blue and white porcelain with a cover, Black tea goes well with purple clay ware with white inside glaze, white porcelain, warm colored ware, or coffee ware. And oolong tea is also excellent in purple clay ware.
