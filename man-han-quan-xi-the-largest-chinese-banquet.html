    <p>Manhan Quanxi, literally the Manchu and Han Banquet, originating in the Qing Dynasty, is the largest Chinese banquet combining the essential delicacies from the Manchu and Han ethnic groups. It is a high peak in the development of Chinese gastronomy. The integration of such an abundant historical background and national culture in one food is perhaps a unique phenomenon in the world.</p>

<h3>Origin of Man han Qun xi</h3>

<p>Manhan Quanxi was introduced during Emperor Kangxi’s reign at the government house and official residence of the upper strata. It derived from changes in the eating and drinking customsof the Manchus before and after the Manchu rulers moved to Beijing. Before they moved, the banquet had been called the” Manhan Bun banquet. It was cooked simply, and there was little variety in the food served. Most dishes were made of wheat flour and served in large quantities, as was typical of the dietetic customs of the nomadic people. By the middle Qing Dynasty, the eating habits of the Manchus had been greatly influenced by the eating customs and cooking skills of other nationalities, especially Hans.</p>

<p>In the 53rd year of Kangxi’s reign (1714), Emperor Kang Xi gave a 1,000 Elders’ Banquet at the palace to celebrate his60th birthday and the peaceful times under his rule. The emperor dined with his guests and, in a joyful mood, wrote the four big characters, Man Han Quan Xi, thus establishing the rare banquet’s place in Chinese dietetic culture. The banquet featured many of the world’s edible delicacies from land and sea, famous mushrooms and fungi, and choice vegetables and fruits. Quality was the key selection criteria, and only the best were chosen. An example was the preparation of roast pigs. The pigs must weigh 12 to 13 catties and must have been fattened with porridge for three to four days before being slaughtered so they would be more tasty.</p>

<h3>Formularized Manhanquanxi</h3>

<p>The luxurious Manhan Quanxi followed a set etiquette, procedure, and pattern. All officials had to wear their official robes and a string of 108 beads typically made of coral or amber. Dinnerware was placed at each seat. After the guests were seated, fruits were peeled for them and cold dishes were served to begin the wine drinking. This was followed by four hot courses. After three rounds of drinks, shark’s fin was served followed by the second course a hot dish of meat, then the third and fourth courses. The fifth course was cooked rice, porridge, and soup, After the dinner, a small silver tray of toothpicks, areca (betel nut), and round cardamom kernels were served. To end the banquet, the guests were given a basin of clean water for washing.</p>

<h3>Ups and Downs of Manhan Quanxi</h3>

<p>ManhanQuanxi became very popular during Xianfeng’s reign. After Emperor Xianfeng’s death, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered that the name , ManhanQuanxi, not be used outside the palace. Later, Emperor Guangxu issued an order that only princes, dukes, and generals were entitled to Manhan Quanxi, which caused it to rebound in Tianjin and other cities. Following the 1911 Revolution, Manhan Quanxi became fashionable in more cities, but the content, etiquette, customs, and formalities were gradually simplified, and the number of dishes reduced from more than 200 to about 100. Archived menus showed different banquets serving 110 dishes, 108 dishes, and 64 dishes. There was no longer any clear distinction between Manchu and Han dishes, so the banquet became known as the Great Han Banquet in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. After the Republic of China was founded in 1911, Manhan Quanxi was suspended because of wars among the warlords and the poverty of the people.</p>

<h3>Modern Manhan Quanxi</h3>

<p>Man han Quan xi, China’s so-called No. 1 feast was on show for the public at an international food festival held in a hotel of Shenyang. About 30 senior chefs along with many assistants spent three days on making 196 different kinds of dishes with a total cost of over 200000 Yuan. More than 80 performers dressed in Qing costumes, along with an extravagant dragon chair and a set of delicate table ware, both of which were specially produced for the feast, helped represent the scenes of a grand banquet in the palace to ordinary people nowadays. However, many of the 200-odd visitors to the festival said it was too wasteful to make such a feast, stating that the cost almost equals to the yearly income of 30 local farmers. What’s worse,  all the costly dishes were dumped after the three: day festival closed. The board chairman of the hotel claimed that the banquet was prepared to highlight China’s food culture and offer a vivid imperial environment to the public.</p>
