    <p>Moon cake is the ubiquitous fare at any celebration of the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, not only because of its delicious taste and charming looking, but also for the cultural and artistic connotation. Moon cake symbolizes the reunion of families and couples. Nowadays, moon cakes with their various flavors and delicate packaging actually have become a kind of artwork.</p>

<h3>Cultural Role</h3>

<p>It is said that moon cakes were used as a medium by the Ming revolutionaries in their espionage effort to secretly distribute letters in order to overthrow the Mongolian rulers of China in the Yuan Dynasty. The idea was said to be conceived by Zhu Yuanzhang and his advisor Liu Bowen, who circulated a rumor that a deadly plague was spreading and the only way to prevent it was to eat the special moon cakes. This prompted the quick distribution of the moon cakes, which were used to hide a secret message coordinating the Han Chinese to revolt on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month.</p>

<p>Another legend is hiding the message in the surface of moon cakes as a simple puzzle or mosaic. In order to read the encrypted message, each of the 4 moon cakes packaged together must be cut into 4 parts each. The 16 pieces of moon cakes must then be pieced together in such a fashion that the secret message could be read. The pieces of moon cakes were then eaten right away to destroy the message.</p>

<h3>Variety of Moon Cakes</h3>

<p>Traditional moon cakes have an imprint on top consisting of the Chinese characters for longevity” or harmony” as well as the names of the bakery and filling in the moon cake. Imprints of a moon, a woman named Change on the moon, flowers, vines, or a rabbit may surround the characters for additional decoration. Common flings in the moon cakes are lotus seed paste, bean paste, jujube paste, and a mixture of five types of nuts and seeds. There are many regional variants of moon cakes as well. Types of traditional moon cakes include: Cantonese-style moon cakes, Suzhou-style moon cakes, Beijing-style moon cakes, Chaoshan style moon cakes, Ningbo style moon cakes, and Yunnan-style moon cakes.</p>

<p>Modern varieties of moon cakes are different from their traditional counterparts in that their crusts typically do not require baking. Instead, they require refrigerating. The launch of a champagne truffle snow-skin moon cake in 1994 by Raffles Hotel in Singapore, triggered a wave of modern moon cakes. Häagen-Dazs quickly followed on from this innovation, and was one of the first to create an ice -cream moon cake.</p>
