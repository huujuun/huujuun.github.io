    <p>Noodles are the world’s second most consumed food made of flour, after bread. Since ancient times, noodle shave not only fed the Chinese but also brought them plenty of fun. In China, noodles can be eaten in so many different ways: by cutting them with scissors, chopping them with a knife, tearing them with one’s hands, stretching them, and pulling them with chopsticks.</p>

<h3>Zhajiang Mian</h3>

<p>Zhajiang Mian (literally fried sauce noodles) is a northern Chinese dish consisting of thick wheat noodles topped with a mixture of ground pork stir -fried with fermented soybean paste. In Beijing cuisine, soybean paste is used, while in Tianjin and other parts of China, sweet sauce, hoisin sauce, or broad bean paste may be used in place of the soybean paste. In the cuisines of Beijing, Tianjin, and northeastern China, the soybean paste is stir-fried rather than fried, and oil is not used. Zhajiang Mian is sometimes referred to by the nickname Chinese Spaghetti in the West, which is symmetrical to Chinese calling spaghetti Bolognese “Western Zhajiang Mian”.</p>

<h3>Dandan Mian</h3>

<p>Dandan Mian, a Sichuan variation, is so named because it was sold by mobile food stands carried by the vendor on a shoulder pole (dandan). Many people know this noodle style as spicy and tongue-numbing. But actually the noodles come with a topping consisting of different ingredients, which include a spicy ground peanut and sesame sauce, garlic, cold sliced cucumbers.</p>

<h3>Yi Mein</h3>

<p>Yi Mein is a variety of flat Chinese egg noodles made from wheat flour. They are known for their golden yellow color and chewy characteristics. The slightly chewy and slightly spongy texture of the noodles are due to the soda water used in making the dough (as opposed to regular noncarbonated water). The noodles are used most frequently in the Cantonese cuisine of southern China and Hong Kong. They are also popular among overseas Chinatowns..</p>

<h3>Shaved Noodles</h3>

<p>Making shaved noodles is as much a feast for the eyes as the mouth. A chef stands in front of a big pot of boiling water, a lump of noodle dough in one hand and a thin, arc-shaped knife in the other. He shaves off bits of dough into the boiling water. A top chef can shave 200 bits a minute. A tale about the origin of shaved noodles is popular among locals. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, the government confiscated all weapons, even knives for cooking. Ten households were allowed to share just one knife. Then， one day, an old woman was preparing noodles for lunch and her husband went to borrow the knife from their neighbor ,but found it being used. On his way home the man picked up a thin piece of iron. How can we use it to cut noodles? his wife complained. Her husband replied, If we can’t cut it, let’s shave it. Since then the tradition of making shaved noodles has been carried on.</p>

<h3>Regan Mian</h3>

<p>Wuhan’s Regan Mian, along with Shanxi’s shaved noodles, Liangguang’s Yi Mein, Sichuan’s Dandan Mian, and northern China’s Zhajiang Mian are collectively referred to as China’s five famous noodles. Regan Mian is a typical breakfast fare of Wuhan. The noodles should be 80% cooked, stirred with cooking oil, and allowed to dry. This is usually done in the previous evening. When a bowl of noodles is to be served for breakfast, the noodles are lowered in a large cone- shaped strainer into a pot of boiling water. Then the noodles are stirred to make sure they are heated evenly, until cooked approximately 30 seconds. The noodles are then strained with a few shakes and served in a bowl topped with oil, soy sauce, sesame paste, pickled vegetables, and chopped chives, with chili sauce and rice vinegar added to taste.</p>

<h3>Fangbian Mian</h3>

<p>The instant food era began with the arrival of Master Kang, a top instant noodle brand, in the mainland in August 1992. Statistics show that China produced a total 48.9 billion bags of instant noodles in 2007, with a value of 35.7 billion yuan. China is certainly the world’s biggest market for instant noodles. In December 2008, China issued a national standard for instant noodles. The new standard, for the first time, states the protein content of instant noodles to ensure the nutritional value of the food. The standard says that protein must account for no less than 8% of the contents and any food additives must be marked on the packaging. Upper limit of fat for fried instant noodles cooked in water and instant noodles cooked by frying should be22% and 25% respectively.</p>
