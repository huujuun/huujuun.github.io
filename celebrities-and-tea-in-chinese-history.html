<h3>Legendary Introduction of Tea into Tibet</h3>

<p>There is a legend in Tibetan historical records about the introduction of tea into Tubo. Dorsum Monbuchi fell seriously ill. One day, a beautiful bird came to him with a twig in its beak. He felt curious, and tasted the leave, which he found very delicately fragrant. After being boiled with water, it made a superior drink. He ordered his liegemen to look for more samples of this twig. At last, they found them in the area inhabited by the Han people. They brought back the leaves to Tubo and Dorsum Monbuchi; soon recovered.</p>

<h3>Tea with Emperors</h3>

<p>Most tea parties in the Forbidden City were held in Wenhua Hall, Chonghua Palace, or Qianqing Palace. As early as the Ming Dynasty, it became an important rite for tea to be served inWenhua Hall when the emperors listened to lectures. After the lectures, the emperor asked those present to take a seat and to have some tea. Tea was served in a solemn atmosphere not only in the palace, but also in the Confucius Temple and in the Imperial Academy. This showed that the tea offered by the emperor was a symbol to spread Confucian doctrine and ethics and to promote education. The Qing Dynasty Emperor Qianlong was a tea lover and a great tea drinker. It is said that he wanted to retire from his throne in his late years, and some ministers asked: How can a nation be without an emperor even for a single day? Qianlong replied with a smile, How can the emperor be without tea for a single day?</p>

<h3>Elegance in Tea Cup</h3>

<p>Men of letters in the past all had indissoluble relation with tea. For scholars, tea was noble and left much room for reflection, embodying high morality. A dialogue between Su Shi and Sima Guang in the Song Dynasty well demonstrated this. Sima Guang asked Su Shi, Tea and Chinese ink are quite opposite in nature because tea needs to be clear while Chinese ink needs to be dark, tea tends to be strong while Chinese ink tends to be light, and tea is better to be new while Chinese ink is better to be old. How come you like them both so much? Su Shi answered the question wisely; Tea and ink have things in common, too. Rare tea and good ink both emit nice smell and both have hard shell, so they are quite similar in virtue. What Su Shi said was highly approved of by Sima Guang.</p>

<p>The great poet, Bai Juyi, was perhaps the most mass-friendly poet in old China. Bai Juyi often had tea with local monks during his tenure in Hangzhou and was delighted therein. He wrote over 20 poems on tea and even wrote a biography for tea, comparing it to a noble and capable minister. Many people copied Bai’s poems to trade for tea in the market.</p>

<p>Li Qingzhao of the Song Dynasty was a most eminent female poet in Chinese history; she also stood for the tea-loving females. Li and her husband had a lot in common, both fond of tea and reading. She often betted with the husband, and the winner got for drinking tea first; Li Qingzhao won the bet more often and would laugh heartily with a tea cup in hand. But the tea often spilled out because of her laughing, and she ended up drinking none. Later, the Song Dynasty was threatened by ethnic groups and lost the territory in the north of Yangtze River. Li Qingzhao’s husband was killed in the wartime chaos. Losing both a family and a country, Li’ S poems were filled with sadness and bitterness.</p>
