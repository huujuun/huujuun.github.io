    <p>China’s history, there are a lot of anecdotes and interesting stories about liquor. Liquor, more than any other beverage, has a great impact on Chinese artists and men of letters, as it seems that many of them produce their  peak masterpieces in the state of drunkenness. In literary works, there exist a greater number of rather popular descriptions as well as stories related to alcoholic beverages.</p>

<h3>Rewarding Armies with A Single Cup of Liquor</h3>

<p>During the Spring and Autumn Period of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty，Gou Jian, King of Kingdom Yue, after being defeated by Fu Chai, King of Kingdom Wu, ordered his people to give more births so as to realize his goal of restoring a dethroned monarch. He encouraged those with more births with alcohol: the couple having one more son would be rewarded with two jars of alcohol and one dog，and the couple having one more daughter would be rewarded with two jars of alcohol and one young pig. Before King Gou Jian led his armies to suppress Kingdom Wu,his people presented mellow alcohol to him. He didn’t enjoy it by himself, but poured it into the upper part of a river and shared it with all the officers and soldiers, which highly inspired and encouraged all the armies. Nowadays, there still exists an alcoholic drink named ”Tou Lao He”，namely, Pouring Into-River Drink.</p>

<h3>Drinking Alone by Moonlight</h3>

<p>Li Bai is regarded as the greatest romantic poet of the Tang Dynasty and a representative of the high Tang culture, combination of realistic Northern culture represented by Confucian philosophy and romantic Southern culture represented by Taoist philosophy. But he could neither fulfill his Confucian ideal to serve the country nor find spiritual freedom in Taoism. So he could only chant poetry and drink liquor to drown his sorrow. Guo Moruo once compiled statistics about Li’s poems and found 17 percent of them were about drinking. Now let’s appreciate one of Li Bai’s most famous poems, Drinking Alone by Moonlight.
A cup of liquor, under the flowering trees; I drink alone, for no friend is near.
Raising my cup I beckon the bright moon;
For her, with my shadow, will make three men.
The moon, alas, is no drinker of liquor;
Listless, my shadow creeps about at my side.
Yet with the moon as friend and the shadow as slave; I must make merry before the spring is spent. To the songs I sing the moon flickers her beams; in the dance I weave my shadow tangles and breaks. While we were sober, three shared the fun; now we are drunk, each goes his way.
May we long share our odd, inanimate feast; and meet at last on the Cloudy River of the sky.</p>

<h3>Setting Fire on the First Family in the White House</h3>

<p>At the end of February 1972, Nixon returned to Washington after signing Sino-U.S. Shanghai Joint Communique with Zhou Enlai. The successful visit to China made the President feel excited. The improvised performance of Zhou Enlai in burning the liquor impressed him deeply. When he told his daughter some interesting things during his visit to China, he wanted her to sense the “interest” of Maotai. He poured a bottle of Maotai into a bowl and burned it. To his surprise, the blue flame jumped, and never died out, soon it broke the bowl. Immediately the burning Maotai flowed over the desk, and it made all members of the First Family of the U.S. feel startled. They tried all means to extinguish the fire. After that, Kissinger humorously said, “Extinguishing the fire has prevented the tragedy of a nation. Or else, Nixon government will end sooner.” In his talks with Deng Xiaoping in 1974, Kissinger also mentioned the event, and told Deng Xiaoping, insignificant way: “Do you know you almost burned the White House?” Originally, Nixon wanted to simulate the performance of Zhou Enlai, but he neglected the essential issue of quantity. What Zhou Enlai burned is a small cup, while what Nixon burned is a big bowl. It is no wonder why Maotai can make the Nixon family a group of frenzy fire fighters.</p>

<h3>Qingdao International Beer Festival</h3>

<p>Since 1991, coastal Qingdao has made a name for itself internationally with its yearly Qingdao International Beer Festival. The 2009 Qingdao International Beer Festival kicks off at Beer City, stretching for 16 full days before a closing ceremony, Every year, the Qingdao International Beer Festival provides both locals and tourists with beer drinking contests, live music, beer carnival games, and a mix of tasty food and of course, all the beer you can possibly imagine. There are over a hundred beer brands not just from China, but also from Asia, Europe, and the rest of the world. Head down to the beer halls as well and take part in the beer tasting so you can try out some of the world’s best beers. Shandong’s Tsingtao Beer Company applied for a permit to replicate Germany’s favorite beer festival in 1991, and to its surprise, the Qingdao Municipal Government wholeheartedly supported the idea.</p>
