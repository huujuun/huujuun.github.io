<h3>Bai Ethnic Minority: Three-Course Tea</h3>

<p>The three-course tea of the Bai ethnic minority is a dramatic tea ceremony. In three-course tea, the brewing techniques and materials used in each course are different from each other. The first course of tea is called “bitter tea, meaning that one will suffer a lot before starting the career. The second course of tea is called sweet tea”. After serving the first course, the host will empty the pot and repeat the procedure right from the beginning. This time, the host will add brown sugar, a special fan-shaped dairy product, and Chinese cinnamon into the handless cup before pouring the tea into the cup with an amount of 810 cup. .The third course of tea is aftertaste tea. The brewing procedure is the same as the previous ones, but materials added in the handless cup change to honey, popcorn, prickly ash, and walnut kernel with a water amount of 610 or 7/10 cup, One will find flavor of sweet, sour, bitter, and pungent in the tea which remind the taster bitter comes first, sweet comes second”.</p>

<h3>Dai Ethnic Minority: Bamboo- "ube Tea</h3>

<p>Bamboo-tube tea is known as “Laduo” in Dai language. A handful of fresh tender tea leaves is placed in a tube of the Fragrant Bamboo species and roasted over an open charcoal fire. When the leaves shrink, a wooden stick is poked into the tube to press them tight, and new leaves are put in. This is repeated until there is no room in the tube for more leaves. When the roasting is finished, the tube is split open, and the tea leaves are retrieved. The host then breaks off a piece of tea from the tea column, puts it in a bowl, instills it in billing water from a brass kettle, brews it for a while, and serves it to the guests. The bamboo-tube tea has the pure taste of tea as well as the strong flavor of bamboo.</p>

<h3>Dong Ethnic Minority: Oil Tea</h3>

<h3>Naxi Ethnic Minority: The Fight between Dragon and Tiger Tea</h3>

<p>The Fight Between Dragon and Tiger” tea, a kind of tea mixed with liquor mainly distilled from sorghum or maize, is regarded as a good medicine to dispel cold, so it is favored by the Naxi people. The brewing method of the Fight between Dragon and Tiger” tea is also very special. First, put some tea in a pot when the water is boiling on the fire, and then bake the tea together with the pot.

When the scent of the tea is baked out, pour the boiling water in the pot and cook it for 3-5 minutes. At the same time, pour liquor into a cap-cup with an amount of half cup, and then add the tea into the same cup. When the two kinds of liquid mixed, they will give out a crack sound, which is regarded as a good omen by the Naxi people, hence the louder the sound, the happier the people on the spot.</p>
