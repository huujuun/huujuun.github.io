    <p>Tea is produced in over 20 Chinese provinces. Tea bushes are cultivated in the mountain  areas of tropical and subtropical regions or wherever there is proper climate, sufficient humidity，adequate sunshine， and fertile soil. Chinese tea is classified in many ways, e.g., quality, method of preparation, or place of production.</p>

<p>It is customary in China to classify the many varieties of tea into six main categories according to their production methods, including fermentation, heating, drying, and addition of other ingredients like flowers, herbs, or fruits. These help to develop the special flavor of the raw tea leaves.</p>

<h3>Green Tea</h3>

<p>Green tea is the most popular type and produced in the largest quantities of all teas in China. In green shades it is so named, as the dried leaves and the infusion are both in green shades. Green tea is made by briefly steaming the just plucked leaves, rendering them soft and pliable, and preventing them from fermenting or changing color. After steaming, the leaves are rolled, then spread out and fried” (dried with hot air or pan-fried in a wok) until they are crisp. The resulting greenish-yellow tea has a green, slightly astringent flavor close to the taste of the fresh leaf.</p>

<h3>Black Tea</h3>

<p>Black tea is a fermented tea. Unlike green tea, black tea does not lose its fragrance easily so it is suitable for long distance transportation. This may explain why this type of tea was exported to the West. Although green tea has recently seen a revival due to its purported health benefits, black tea still accounts for over ninety percent of all tea sold in the West.</p>

<h3>White Tea</h3>

<p>The leaves of white tea are covered with white fuzz, hence its name. It is a local specialty of Fujian Province, mainly produced in Fuding, Zhenghe, Songxi and Jianyang counties. When steeped in boiling water, white tea bears a pale yellowish green, and is both clear and fragrant. White tea is said to help prevent and resist cancers, prevent sunstroke, function as an antidote for poison, and cure toothache. These medicinal qualities result from the tea being stored for years. The most famous varieties are Silver Needles White Fuzz  and White Peony.</p>

<h3>Brick Tea</h3>

<p>As the name implies, brick tea is a tea that has been formed into a brick-like shape, It is a kind of laminated product with tea leaves and tea stems. This kind of tea is popular with ethnic groups in the border regions. The most famous variety is Pu’er tea made in Yunnan province. In order to preserve Pu’er tea and to facilitate its trade with merchants travelling the Tea-Horse Road, a method was developed, which led to the steaming of Pu’er tea and then compressing it into various shapes.</p>

<h3>Scented Tea</h3>

<p>As a special kind of tea in China, scented tea is a mixture of flowers with green tea, black tea, or oolong tea. The flowers include jasmine, orchid, gardenia, rose, and sweet-scented osmanthus, etc., with jasmine being the most popular. There are strict rules about the proportion of flowers to tea. If there are too many flowers, the scent of flowers will dilute that of tea; if too few, the tea is not perfectly scented.</p>

<h3>Oolong Tea</h3>

<p>Known as a half-fermented tea, oolong tea is an excellent combination of the freshness of green tea and the fragrance of black tea. Oolong tea grows on cliffs, and the difficult picking process makes it the most precious in China. Oolong tea can remind tea gourmets of Kungfu tea, since it is the best variety for making the brew.</p>

<h3>Cooking with tea</h3>

<p>Cooking with tea is as old as the history of tea itself. Recently, it has become popular to cook with green tea in powder and liquid form for a wide array of health benefits and the distinct flavor. Now the big question, how do I cook with green tea? A very simple way is to substitute the water in a recipe with green tea brew. The stronger the tea, the stronger its flavor and color will remain in the end product. A lot of green tea recipes will ask for green tea powder or matcha, which is ground-up green tea leaves and used for Japanese tea ceremony purposes. Green tea ice cream is a Japanese ice cream flavor. This flavor is extremely popular in Japan and other parts of East Asia, and almost all ice cream manufacturers produce a version of it, including foreign vendors such as Haagen-Dazs.</p>
