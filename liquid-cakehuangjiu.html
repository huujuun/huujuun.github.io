    <p>Huangjiu is a type of Chinese alcoholic beverage brewed directly from grains such as rice, millet, or wheat. Unlike Baijiu, such liquors are not distilled and contain less than20% alcohol. These liquors are traditionally pasteurized, aged, and filtered before their final bottling for sale to consumers. The various styles of huangjiu may vary in color from clear to beige, yellowish-brown, or reddish-brown.</p>

<h3>History of Huangjiu</h3>

<p>Early huangiu brewing techniques before the Xia Dynasty were not well recorded. However we found the first reference to the existence of huangjiu in Jiagu Wen. At least three types of alcoholic drinks made from cereals were mentioned. The first being “Jiu”， it was probably made from cereals which were scarified and fermented with distillery’s yeast by Jiu Qu ; the second being ”Li”, it was made from malted cereals and was similar to primitive beer; and finally the third being“Chang”, it was a kind of quality huangjiu flavored by adding tulip herb.</p>

<h3>Shaoxing Huangjiu</h3>

<p>As early as 7,000 years ago， the ancient Yue(short form of Shaoxing) people began brewage out of rice， and the brewing of huangjiu had already become popular among the people in the times of Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun. It was the Qing Dynasty, the most prosperous time of huangjiu that witnessed huangiu brewing workshops all over the country. At present， there are many types o fhuangitu across the nation, and the long-standing brand of Shaoxing huangjiu shines because of its sophisticated procedure and high quality. It is one of the only two liquor-related items inscribed in China’s ICH (Intangible Cultural Heritage). The other beverage is Luzhou Laojiao of Southwest Sichuan Province.</p>

<p>In 2007， the China Huangjiu Museum officially opened in Shaoxing. The museum is designed as a research center on the techniques and culture of huangiu, and a place for both academic studies and tourism. Tourists can take time enjoying huangjiu ceremony performances there， and can also make use of the underground cellar of the museum to temporarily store their huangjiu they have purchased at the museum.</p>

<h3>The yellow wine of Huadiao</h3>

<p>Huadiao is hailed as the First-Class Liquid Cake and enjoys great popularity among the varieties of Shaoxing huangjiu. It evolves from the ancient folk custom of NverHong Liquor in Shaoxing. When a girl was born, the family would carve lucky designs on the containers and then bury  the liquor underground. On the girl’s wedding day, the family members would dig up the bottles and repaint them in flashy colors for the wedding banquet. People later began to bottle the liquor in pots with patterns carved on them, hence the name Huadiao. In1995, the movie NverHong, directed by Xie Yan, son of Chinese well-known director Xie Jin, was released. This Chinese melodrama chronicles four decades in the life of a liquor maker’s daughter. The story begins in Shaoxing during the 1920s. What the movie shows at the beginning is the liquor maker and his wife celebrating the birth of their daughter Huadiao. The jubilant father even names that year’s liquor Nv’er Hong and stores away a special jar for his daughter’s marriage.</p>
