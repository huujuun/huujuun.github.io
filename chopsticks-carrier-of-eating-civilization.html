    <p>By contrast, chopsticks have been the utensil of choice throughout all of China since the Han Dynasty. Given their prominence in Asian culture, chopsticks have transcended the boundaries of food. Poems have been written about them. Researchers at Hong Kong Polytechnic University put the basic concept behind chopsticks to good use when designing the Mars Rock Corer.</p>

<h3>History of Chopsticks</h3>

<p>Chopsticks were first mentioned in Liji (The Book of Rites), apiece of works compiled some 2000 years ago. The initial chopsticks were in the form of twigs, which the primitive Chinese must have used to pick up a roast after they began to use fire. The twigs then evolved into the wooden, tapering sticks as we know them today. In ancient times, chopsticks were called “Zhư”.At that time, our ancestors liked to steam or boil food. It was difficult for them to use spoons to dip vegetables in the soup. So they cleverly invented “Zhu” to nip food, thus it became the most convenient tableware in their lives. The appearance of chopsticks said goodbye to those days when our Chinese ancestors had to use their hands to grab food, so they featured the coming of civilization to food culture.</p>

<p>Chopsticks were definitely in use by the Shang Dynasty, during which chopsticks became two sticks of the same length. In the late Shang Dynasty, the tyrannical King Zhou ordered his craftsmen to make chopsticks from elephants’ teeth, which were seen to be the most luxurious chopsticks in the early history of Chinese food culture. In the Spring and Autumn Period, copper andiron chopsticks came into being. The great Chinese philosopher Confucius strongly advocated chopsticks. Under cultivation of Confucianism, Chinese people deem knife and fork as bearing sort of violence, like cold weapons.</p>

<h3>Chopsticks Etiquette</h3>

<p>There is strict etiquette surrounding the use of chopsticks. For example, spearing something like a jiaozi, sucking or licking chopsticks, waving them around at other people, and using them to pull a dish of food towards you are all considered very bad manners. If you need to rest your chopsticks, leave them on the chopsticks rest or by the side of your bowl or plate. Do not stick them into a bowl of rice because their appearance resembles that of incense sticks lit in remembrance of the dead. To the Chinese, each meal is a celebration of life so they don’t usually mix eating with grief. Don’t tap on your bowl with your chopsticks, since that will be deemed insult to the host or the chef. There are superstitions associated with chopsticks, too. If you find an uneven pair at your table setting, it means you are going to miss a boat ,a plane, or a train. Dropping chopsticks will inevitably bring bad luck. The correct way to use chopsticks is to hold the pair in the hollow between the thumb and the forefinger of your more flexible hand. The one closer to your body should rest on the first joint of the ring finger and stay relatively immobile. Hold the other one with the forefinger and the middle finger, and manipulate it like pincers to pick up the food. The strength applied by the fingers should vary with the things to be taken hold of. The skill to pick up, with speed and dexterity, small things like beans and peanuts, and slippery things like slices of preserved eggs can only come from practice and coordinated action of the fingers.</p>
