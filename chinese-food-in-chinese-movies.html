    <p>Food is at the center of, or at least it accompanies or symbolizes, many social interactions. It can be used to heighten or relax people’s emotions, to communicate trivial or vital messages. What could be better than indulging your love of food while being entertained at the same time? Here are a few of the most memorable Chinese food movie scenes.</p>

<h3>Eat Drink Man Woman</h3>

<p>The movie is directed by Ang Lee and released in 1994. It tells the story of a semi-retired and widowed Chinese master chefChu and his family living in mo2dern day Taipei, Taiwan. Atypical scene is that every Sunday Chu prepares an elaborate dinner for his three daughters. Despite Chu’s exotic dishes, the family barely nibbles at the food. The listless mealtime ritual mirrors the foursome’s general lack of appetite for life. The film features numerous scenes displaying the technique and artistry of gourmet Chinese cooking. Over 100 different recipes are used in Eat Drink Man Woman with each dish authentically prepared for its presentation on the screen. In addition, the actors have also been coached on the physical preparation of the dishes that will be prepared by their characters on camera.</p>

<h3>THE CHINESE FEAST</h3>

<p>Blending martial arts and Chinese haute cuisine, The Chinese Feast puts on a dazzling exhibition of“cook-fu”, rival chefs compete with acrobatic dexterity to tum ordinary dishes like stir-fried rice noodles with beef and sweet and sour pork into culinary masterpieces. As in the“cook-fu” epic Tampopo, their attempts to be master chefs mimic the proforma training sequences in martial arts film. The film culminates in a three-day cooking contest to re-create the majestic Manhan Quanxi. Exquisite dishes such as snowy bear palms, succulent monkey brain, and statues made out of tofu are all captured in cinematography that is as mouthwatering as the food scenes in Eat Drink Man Woman. Though the film may seem like a straightforward comedy, director Tsui Hark injects a serious note into his story: uniting Chinese from all over the world around their shared passion for food.</p>

<p>This film, based on the novel by Amy Tan, explores the relationship between four mothers，who were born in China and eventually arrived in America， and their daughters. Given the important role food plays in Chinese culture, it’s not surprising that many of the most dramatic moments take place either in the kitchen or at the dinner table. In one classic scene, the boyfriend of one of the daughters inadvertently insults his future mother- in-law when he agrees that a dish she has prepared tastes too salty. To make the matter worse ,he proceeds to douse his food in soy sauce.</p>

<h3>The Firm</h3>

<p>The movie is about a recent law school graduate Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise), who finds an offer of employment by a Memphis law firm too good to pass up. Unfortunately, he soon discovers that working for the firm” means engaging in a number of illegal activities. In the scene where Mitch has just had his initial interview, he returns home to share the good news with his wife and prepares a romantic candlelit dinner while waiting. The table is decorated with fancy china, linen place mats, and long, tapered candles. And what menu has Mitch chosen to celebrate their new life in Memphis? Here they come: Chinese take -out, including Mushu Pork, Sichuan beef, and roast duck.</p>
