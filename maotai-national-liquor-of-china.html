    <p>In major historic events, like the talks in Geneva, and establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the U.S., Maotai acts as the special medium melting the hard ice of history. At numerous times, leaders of the Party and of the country have presented Maotai as the “National Gift” to leaders of foreign countries. So Maotai has enjoyed the reputation of being “Diplomatic Liquor” and “Friendship Liquor”.</p>

<h3>History of Maotai</h3>

<p>The liquor produced at Maotai (in present Guizhou) in the Western Han Dynasty had already been used as tributes to be enjoyed by emperors and local officials. As early as 135 B.C., the ancient town of Maotai began producing Medlar Sauce Liquor in the Han Dynasty, which was considered as the predecessor of Maotai liquor. One government official took a sample of this drink to Emperor Wudi of the Han Dynasty, who called it “Honey-Like Nectar”. It became the first recorded case of the alcohol being produced in Maotai. However, due to inconvenient traffic, the scale of production was small. During the reign of Emperor Qianlong, Chishui River Channel was built, and Maotai Town became the place for the distribution of salt transported to Guizhou Province. By the years of Emperor Daoguang, there were crowds of merchants and peasants in Maotai. The demand or liquor increased with each passing day, which stimulated the development of the brewing industry and the improvement of the liquor brewing technique. As described by Zheng Zhen, the famous poet of the Qing Dynasty, Maotai tops Guizhou, and salt passes Chishui River”.</p>

<h3>Why can't Maotai be cloned?</h3>

<p>The unique landscape, fine water quality, special soil, and the subtropical climate are the natural barriers for brewing Maotai outside the town of Maotai. From the 1960s to the 1970s, relevant experts used the technique, raw materials, and vault soil as well as workers and technical personnel of Maotai Town to produce Maotai liquor outside the town, but none of the products thus produced could have the same effect. The broomcorn used for the production of Maotai is the sticky broomcorn, which is locally called Red-Tassel Broomcorn”. Formation of the organic matters in Maotai, which is closely related to the broomcorn and the regional microorganism groups, contributes to the delicacy, purity, and long aftertaste of Maotai. If the unique regional and special raw materials of Maotai are endowed by the nature, thenthe unique brewing technique of Maotai can be said to be the excellent work of skilled liquor craftsmen. The fermentation of Maotai is carried out alternately in closed and open containers, the resulting brew has to age for about four years.</p>

<h3>The National Liquor</h3>

<p>In 1915, in order to commemorate the opening of navigation of Panama Canal, the U.S. held Panama World Fair. Maotai liquor was sent over for exhibition. Unfortunately ‘preparations for the event did not go as well as planned. Visitor sat the expo walked past Maotai without noticing the product, and even the judges were reluctant to take a taste from the suspicious looking bottles, One of the Maotai representatives got so frustrated that he smashed one of the unattractive bottles on the floor, The bottle shattered into small pieces, and the extraordinary odor of the drink spread into the exposition area. People gathered around, attracted by the aroma, and ultimately the drink received several mentions. This helped Maotai become the representative of China’s national industry and trade that was known to the world. On the eve of the National Foundation Ceremony in 1949, Premier Zhou Enlai held a meeting in Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai to determines Maotai as the liquor for the National Foundation Ceremony, Since then, Maotai has been used in the National Day reception of each year. At a national meeting in 1975, WangZhen, then Vice Premier of the State Council, formally declared that Guizhou Maotai is the National Liquor”.</p>

<h3>packaging of Maotai</h3>

<p>In 2007, in the hope of preventing fakes and assuring customers of quality products, Maotai announced plans to up-date its packaging system to include an anti-counterfeit ebonite cap and anti-counterfeit tags. Moutai ‘s anti-counterfeit ebonite cap features “3+2+1 Technology” , which seems to mean a combination of three second-tier anti-counterfeit technologies, two top-tier technologies, and one special code technology. The new cap enables consumers to identify the product and to easily judge whether the product is genuine. Kweichow Moutai is reportedly the first liquor maker in China that has adopted this technology. In addition, the company has also upgraded its anti- counterfeit tags and has replaced them with new ones that have precise printed shading and background color change for consumers to easily distinguish the products.</p>
