    <p>Despite its central role in the Mid-Autumn Festival, the popularity of moon cakes has declined in recent years. Part of the reason is that people are becoming more health-conscious. Traditional moon cakes are made with lard and a lot of sugar. Another reason for the decline in popularity is that the Mid-Autumn Festival has become increasingly commercialized. People are focusing more on the exchange of gifts and less on the traditional celebrations, such that its symbolism has eroded.</p>

<p>To adapt to today’s health-conscious lifestyle, many bakeries offer miniature moon cakes and fat-free moon cakes. Some are made of yogurt, jelly, and fat-free ice-cream. Even high-fiber low-sugar moon cakes have made their appearance. To be competitive, bakers boast about how little sugar and oil they use in their moon cakes. Customers can pick and choose the size and the filling that suit their taste and diet. For added hygiene, each cake is often wrapped in airtight plastic, accompanied by a tiny food preserver packet. The new version is well- accepted among young people in China.</p>

<p>In 2007, Beijing’s moon cake producers revived the spirit of China’s traditional Mid-Autumn Festival by packaging their products in simple, environment-friendly, recycled paper. The recycled paper was introduced to promote the notion of environmental protection among consumers. More than 40 stores joined a municipal government campaign to sell moon cakes in simple packaging. The simply packaged moon cakes were sold at 90 to 180 yuan per box, depending on the quantity and quality, an average 10 percent lower than normal Beijing prices. Customers could still buy moon cakes wrapped in expensive packages as gifts. In the past decade, moon cakes have been packaged in extremely expensive and elaborate boxes made of wood, silk or even gold. In the last two years, the authorities have begun to discourage extravagance and waste in the sales of moon cakes.</p>
