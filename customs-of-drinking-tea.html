    <p>The Chinese haves a saying:” Firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea are the seven necessities to begin a day. “Among the seven things, tea is the only drink. Although it ranks last, it occupies a special position. A simple meal in Chinese is “Cucha Danfan”, namely, coarse tea and plain food.</p>

<h3>Tea and Marriage</h3>

<p>Ancient Chinese considered marriage as the origin of all ceremonies. From courtship to wedding, certain rules and formalities had to be observed and certain gifts had to be presented. This not only showed respect to marriage, but implied people’s good wish to the future marriage. In the Tang Dynasty, custom went so that tea was treated as a betrothal gift. Since the Song Dynasty, tea was even more closely related to wedding. A betrothal gift was also termed tea gift , and to present a betrothal gift was commonly called to present tea. If a girl accepted the gift, that was to drink tea. To return the gift, fruits were usually chosen, sometimes together with tea called to order tea”. In the Qing Dynasty, the wedding ceremony developed to the systemized ceremony of three tea, namely to present tea when proposing, to settle tea in wedding, and to join tea” on the first night of marriage. Even today, in the countryside in many parts of China, engagement is still called to accept tea and the cash gift in engagement is called tea cash. When a boy goes to a girl’s home on a blind date, the girl will serve him tea in person if she is satisfied with him. And the boy will accept the tea if he is also satisfied. The story doesn’t stop at this. Matchmaking, blind date, and bridal night are all accompanied by tea to add some fun. In the traditional Chinese marriage ceremony, both the bride and groom kneel in front of their parents and serve them tea as an expression of gratitude. The parents will usually have a sip of the tea and then give the couple a red envelope, which symbolizes good luck. The tea ceremony during weddings also serves as a means for both parties in the wedding to meet with members of the other family.</p>

<h3>Tea with Guests</h3>

<p>Western people are accustomed to treating guests with coffee while Chinese people prefer tea. Generally, the rule of tea 50%full and wine l00% full” should be observed when serving tea in cups. Hot tea tastes better, and it will get cool down if the guest cannot finish a full cup of tea. When there is only 13 of the brew left in the cup, the host should re-fill the cup. Though tea can help people digest, it is bad for the stomach if one drinks it with an empty belly. So when treating guests with tea, the host usually serves some delicious snacks as accompaniment. Tea is to show not only welcome but refusal as well. In the world of officials in the Qing Dynasty, there was a custom of “serving tea and showing the door”. When a guest came to an official’s home, he was generally treated with tea. But tea drinking was different from wine drinking. The host might persuade his guests to take tea, but he wouldn’t raise the cup for a toast as in wine drinking. If the host didn’t like the visitor, or he had urgent affairs in hand, he would raise his own cup and ask the visitor to drink, hoping that he would leave as soon as the tea was finished.  The guest normally understood and took his leave without actually drinking up the tea.</p>
