    <p>Today, the 56 nationalities, including the Han nationality, live on China’s 9.6 million square kilometers of territory. Along with the Han people, these ethnic groups have added to the profound Chinese civilization with their own fascinating cultures. Their beautiful costumes with unique accessories, diverse food customs, and fascinating traditions, celebrations and history represent significant elements of Chinese civilization. .</p>

<h3>Hui Cuisine</h3>

<p>The Hui ethnic group possesses the most Muslims, which influences the cuisine greatly and makes it the representative of the Chinese Muslim (Qingzhen) food. Most of the staple foods in Hui Cuisine are made of flour rather than rice, with many different forms, for example, lamian (hand-pulled noodles), and “nang”(a kind of crusty pancake), beef noodles. Sweeteners play an important role in the meals with honey or sugar usually added to their dishes. Hui people like eating beef and mutton which stimulate the appetite and nourish the body. One typical food is roast mutton, which is represented by mutton kebabs, roasts whole lamb. In most major cities in China, there are small Islamic restaurants typically run by migrants from Western China ,(especially Uyghurs). Many cafeterias at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students, typically labeled “Qingzhen”.</p>

<h3>Tibetan Cuisine</h3>

<p>Due to the high altitude in Tibet, water there boils at 90degrees thus making cooking with water impossible. And vegetables are scarce in the high altitude, so Tibetan cuisine has become very specialized. It consists mostly of meat, dairy products, and other high-protein foods. In the winter, beef andmutton are cut into long stripes to be air dried. The main staple food in Tibet is tsamba , which is consumed daily. Tsamba is made of roasted Qingke which is ground into very fine flour, mixed with a little butter tea and then rolled into small lumps and eaten with fingers.</p>

<h3>Miao Cuisine</h3>

<p>Most Miao people like to eat sour dishes, and every family has sour soup which is made through fermenting rice or tofu water in a crock for three to five days. Sour soup can be used for cooking meat, fish, or all kinds of vegetables. In order to keep the food in good condition, Miao people usually pickle the vegetables, chicken, fish, and meat in a crock. There is an ancient local saying which states “Without eating a sour dish for three days, people will stagger with weak legs”.</p>

<h3>Dai Cuisine</h3>

<p>Clever and skillful Dai women make use of rice to cook various kinds of staple food. They tread on Mudui (a wooden tool) to pestle paddy, once a day, only enough for use of that day. It is a custom that Dai people do not eat rice pestled the previous day. From November to the next February, it is the season of the Fragrant Bamboo’s maturity, also the best time to enjoy the Fragrant Bamboo rice. Fragrant Bamboo is thus named because of a layer of fragrant film in the stem. To make Fragrant Bamboo rice, the bamboo should be cut in to segments, each segment with a joint at the bottom. The bamboo segments filled with rice are smoldered on a charcoal fire, until the inducing fragrance flies out. Rice pounded into powder or ground into thick liquid can be used to cook various kinds of cakes called Baba.</p>

<p>Roasted dishes in Dai cuisine mostly take fragrant couch grasses as condiments. Fragrant couch grass is a herbage plant, with the function of adding fragrance and wiping off fishy smell. There are many dishes in this cooking method, such as roast fish, roast meat, roast chicken, roast bamboo shoot, roast mushroom, etc.</p>
