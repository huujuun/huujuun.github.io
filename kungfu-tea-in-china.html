    <p>Kungfu denotes any skill that is developed through great practice such as Chinese painting, martial arts. Kungfu tea generally refers to the more formal preparation of Chinese tea using small, unglazed teapots made of purple clay from Yixing, China. Kungfu tea preparation uses short, multiple infusions of a single batch of leaves, which brings out the maximum flavor of tea.</p>

<h3>What is Kungfu Tea?</h3>

<p>Kungfu tea ceremony is a way of preparing tea with great skill in Chaozhou and South Fujian. As the espresso of Chinese teas with a formidable kick, it was first sipped back in the Song Dynasty and is still flourishing and remains an important part of social etiquette in Chaozhou, South China’s Guangdong Province. The first known treatise making references to Kungfu tea was in Lu Yu’s The Classic of Tea. In Kungfu tea, rather than the symbolic hand gestures as in the Japanese tea ceremony, the taste of the tea, is paramount. In essence, what is desired in Kungfu tea is a brew that tastes great and is satisfying to the soul. Tea masters in China and other Asian nations have studied for years perfecting this method in order to do so.</p>

<p>However, method alone will not determine whether a cup of great tea will be produced. It has been suggested that knowledge of chemistry and physics behind Kungfu tea also helps to make this method far more superior than any other in brewing Chinese teas. In Kungfu tea, to which manual skill, high quality tea leaves and water as well as appropriate temperature control are all critical, bringing out the best that the tea, especially the semi-fermented oolong tea, can offer.</p>

<h3>How to Brew Kungfu Tea</h3>

<p>In China’s traditional tea culture, making Kungfu tea has a certain etiquette that goes along with it, a procedure that drinkers should follow. The tea set, small and exquisite, usually comprises a pot and three, sometimes two or four cups. Water for Kungfu tea should be given careful consideration. Pure or mineral water is usually suggested to brew the tea. Tap water should be avoided since its chemical treatment imparts undesirable odors, which interfere with the delicate aromatics of tea. Home filters and other water purification systems can minimize and, in some cases, eliminate this problem. However, distilled or extremely soft water should never be used as they are deficient in crucial minerals and result in a flat-tasting liquor.</p>

<p>Rinse all vessels with hot water, this signifies that the ritual of tea-making has begun by purifying the pot, cleaning it of dust and residue, and making it ready to receive the tea. It also warms the vessels since the hot water is then poured into the serving pitcher and from there into the tasting cups.</p>
