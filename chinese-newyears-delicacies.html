<h3>Jiaozi : Northern Preference</h3>

<p>Jiaozi tops the list of delicacies of people in North China, where people eat jiaozi at midnight on Chinese New Year’s Eve and for breakfast on Chinese New Year’s Day. The shape of jiaozi resembles that of ancient gold and silver ingots or a crescent moon, and symbolizes the hope for a year of plenty. Besides, jiaozi wrapper is circular (Yuan). The Chinese hope for reunion (“Tuanyuan”) and perfection (Yuanman). When a familygets together to bid farewell to the old year and usher in the new, they enjoy reunion and eat jiaozi to hope that they will acquire more wealth and have a better life in the new year, Occasionallypeople will add specific fllings to select jiaozi in order to symbolize certain wishes, Sweets mean a sweeter life; peanuts symbolize long life, and dates and chestnuts represent the imminent arrival of a son.</p>

<p>The fun of eating Jiaozi lies not only in the delicacy itself but also in the process of preparing for it: Everybody will roll up his sleeves and make the wrappers to cover the fillings.</p>

<h3>Niangao : Typical Southern Treat</h3>

<p>In Chinese, “Gao” is a homonym for high. Niangao is also called nianniangao, which is a homonym for higher each year ,symbolizing progress and promotion at work and improvement in life year by year. As the legend goes, one week before the Chinese New Year, the Kitchen God returns to heaven to report on a family’s behaviors during the previous year. A negative report by the Kitchen God means a family will suffer from bad luck during the year to come. In order to ensure a favorable report from the Kitchen God, the custom evolves of feeding him “niangao”. According to different accounts, this is either a bribe, or simply a means of ensuring the Kitchen God’s mouth is too full of niangao to pass on an unfavorable report.</p>

<h3>Farewell to Chinese New Year: Yuanxiao</h3>

<p>With the approach of Lantern Festival (marking the end of celebrations of Chinese New Year), Yuanxiao can be seen everywhere, further heightening the festive holiday spirit. The round shape of yuanxiao tangyuan represents the family circle, and eating yuanxiao tangyuan symbolizes the hope for family reunions. Most people take these two kinds of rice foods as the same thing and can’t tell the difference. Actually, the usual method to make tangyuan followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls, make a hole, insert the filling, then close the hole and smooth it out by rolling it between the hands. In North China, the fillings are pressed into hardened cores, dipped lightly in water,  and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour. A layer of the flour sticks to the filing, which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour. And so it goes, like rolling a snowball, until the desired size is formed.</p>
