    <h3>Yin and Yang</h3>

<p>The best representation of the interaction of yin and yang is the Taiji symbol: a perfect circle with two contrasting colors of black and white, creating the    cycle of life together and each containing inside itself the essenceof the opposite energy. Neither can exist alone, just like the daywill lose the essence of a day without the presence of a night.</p>

<h3>Enormous Coverage of Yin and Yang</h3>

<p>The first references to yin and yang come from The I Ching. Taken literally, yin and yang mean the shady side and sunny side of a hill. People commonly think of yin and yang as opposing forces. However, it is more appropriate to view them as a complementary pair. The Chinese believe problems arise not when the two forces are battling, but when there is an imbalance between them in the environment. Floods, divorce, or even a fire in the kitchen can all be the result of disharmony in the forces of yin and yang. How does the concept of yin and yang relate to food? A basic adherence to this philosophy can be found in any Chinese dish, from stir-fried beef with broccoli to sweet and sour pork. There is always a balance in colors, flavors, and textures.</p>

<h3>Do You Eat the Right Things?</h3>

<p>However, belief in the importance of following the principle of yin and yang in the diet extends further. In the Chinese dietetic culture, a person with a yang body should eat more yin foods and vice versa. A person belonging to a yin body type and eating excessive yin foods will drive the body to a yin extreme. The body’s natural defense mechanism will accordingly show signs of rejection, which western medicine describes as food allergies. If the imbalance is not rectified, the person will become ll.  Eating foods that are in contrast to one’s body constitution is beneficial because it balances out the effects. This is why people of cold constitution can eat a lot of heat- excess foods without getting sick and vice versa. The nature of food can also affect one’s moods. Unreasonable intake of hot or yang food may bring about over-excitement while eating cold or yin food overly may cause sadness and fearfulness. Foods that are neutral in nature are fitting for everyone and are said to promote clear thinking and reasoning.</p>

<p>When treating illnesses, an oriental physician will frequently advise dietary changes in order to restore a healthy balance between yin and yang in the patient. For example, let’s say you’re suffering from heartburn, caused by consuming too many spicy(yang) foods. Instead of antacids, you’re likely to take home a prescription for herbal teas to restore yin forces. Similarly, coughs or flu are more likely to be treated with dietary changes rather than antibiotics or cough medicines.</p>

<p>Almost no foodstuff is purely yin or yang it’s more that one characteristic tends to dominate. That explains why there is no complete agreement among experts as to which foods are more yin or yang in nature. It also reinforces that it is not so much each individual ingredient as the balance between ingredients in each dish that is important. With food, yin would be the milder flavor while yang the bolder flavor. Chinese recipes already take advantage of this type of feng-shui balance. Sweet and sour, hot and sour, and strong flavored dishes paired with plain rice are all examples of yin-yang balanced foods.</p>
