    <h3>Confucius And Chinese cuisine</h3>

<p>Confucius attached great importance to diet, regarding it as one of the three basic conditions, along with army and integrity, for running a state. Sharing food with friends and family is an important part of Chinese dietetic tradition. Confucius deemed enjoyment of food as one of the beautiful and gentle things which contributed to the peace and harmony of society.</p>

<h3>Confucius's Influence on Chinese Dietetic Culture</h3>

<p>Confucius advanced many principles of dietetic hygiene and criteria for testing the hygiene of foods. He said foods should not be eaten if they were rotten, improperly cooked, with changed colors, or unclean wine and dried meat bought from the market. He believed foods should be eaten only at mealtime, and meat should not be over- consumed. This belief is reflected in the dietetic culture of the Chinese nation and conforms to dietetic hygiene because meat is not easily digested. Similarly, his advice Do no teat too much” and Do not talk at meals” conforms to the principle of building health through diet. Another dinner table motto from Confucius is “Do not take away the ginger”. Ginger is pungent, functioning in removing dampness, and reducing internal heat and fever.  So eating a bit of it before meals aids health and digestion. Confucius also said: I could not eat without the proper soy sauce.” In his time meat dishes were unsalted, so they were dipped in soy sauce before consumed and different soy sauces were used for different meats. Confucius stressed that the dishes in his meals must be compatible, and did not resign himself to circumstances. Simple as a meal could be, vegetables and melons must be served.” On the relationship between food and sacrifice, Confucius emphasized animal meats offered in sacrificial rites should be selected and cut according to fixed standards, or they could not be eaten. He said. Meats given in sacrificial rites for the head of the state should be consumed the very day and not be kept overnight. Meats offered in sacrifice at home should not be eaten if they were kept longer than three days.</p>

<h3>Confucian Diet (Kongfu Dish)</h3>

<p>Confucius was particular about dieting. He showed people how they could cultivate their palate and delight their senses. The art of cooking encompassed more than food. Culinary etiquette, social sharing of food, presentation and combining of tastes and textures were all important in Confucian diet. He established culinary standards and proper table etiquette.</p>

<p>Most of these are still considered to be the standards for today. The tradition of cutting foods into bite-size pieces during preparation without showing any knives at the table is unique to the  Chinese culture. Confucius taught that while maintaining the integrity of the individual food was important, it was more so to blend tastes, textures, and the use of condiments to give the palate the whole experience. He also stressed the use of color and aroma in the presentation of the dish. From the time of the Han Dynasty till the late Qing Dynasty, chefs would prepare the dishes for celebrations within the Confucian family when important dignitaries, such as high officials, scholars and even emperors came to visit. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty was a particularly frequent visitor. These visitors provided the Confucian family with many opportunities to entertain them with traditional family dishes. Therefore, the specific cuisine in the Confucius family is handed down from generation to generation, known as Confucian Diet.</p>
