    <p>Chinese cuisine may probably be geographically divided into four categories. The dishes that are produced in the area around the Yellow River are called Shandong cuisine. Those dishes produced on the upper reaches of the Changjiang River are Sichuan cuisine. The dishes enjoyed by the people along the lower reaches’ of the Changjiang River are Jiangsu cuisine. And finally the dishes that are popular along the Pearl River are Guangdong cuisine. They are the four famous food schools in Chinese cookery, and form the principal part of Chinese cuisine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shandong cuisine ("ru" cuisine)</li>
<li>Sichuan cuisine("chuan" cuisine)</li>
<li>Jiangsu cuisine("huaiyang" cuisine)</li>
<li>Guangdong cuisine("yue" cuisine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Shandong cuisine is the representative of the dishes of North China, which includes Beijing dishes, Shandong dishes, etc. Among them, Beijing dishes are best at stir-frying, baking, chafing, quick- frying and braising. Shandong dishes are famous for their delicate fragrance, fresh tenderness and pure tastes, and can be divided into Jinan dishes and Jiaodong dishes.</p>

<p>Sichuan cuisine has a long history which originated from the ancient kingdoms of the Ba and Shu. After the late period of the Qing Dynasty it gradually formed a food school rich in its own typical local flavors. It’s characterized by having light and strong, hot and peppery flavor, known as One dish one taste, Hundred dishes hundred tastes. Its represented by the delicacies from Chengdu, Chongqing and Zigong each in the west, east and middle south of Sichuan respectively. During the long and common development, it has formed its unique style characterized by the diversity in the use of seasonings, the unique culinary skills, the great variety of cooking ingredients, the changes in styles and the adaptability to all tastes. It can be found every-where in the world.</p>

<p>Jiangsu cuisine is famous both at home and abroad for its unique history and characteristics. It is characterized by strict selection of ingredients and meticulous preparation. The ingredients are mainly freshwater products, which are seasonal, tender and fresh. It stresses on the degree and duration of heating and its skill in stewing. Through the regulation of the degree and duration of heating, dishes of different characteristics can be made. They can be either fresh, fragrant, crisp , tender , sticky or well-down. Jiangsu cuisine has assimilated the fresh, crisp and sweet characteristics of southern dishes as well as the salt and colorful character of northern dishes and formed its own flavor. As a result, its dishes have both salt and sweet tastes. Jiangsu cooks are quite skillful at shaping and coloring dishes. Jiangsu cuisine is highly artistic in that it attaches importance to the organic combination of colors and utensils, the proper proportions of meat and vegetables and its cultural characteristics.</p>

<p>Guangdong cuisine is well-known in the world for its flavors of South China and has a style of its own by merging the strong points of the Beijing, Jiangsu and Huaiyang dishes and absorbing such features of the western-style food as shallow-frying and deep- frying. As it’s quite delicious and appealing, there has gone a saying that A feast for the gods is in Guang-zhou. In Guangdong dishes, the use of materials is very extensive and almost nothing short of’ birds, beasts, fishes, snakes ,or even insects is expected from range of food , which causes their superiority over other local dishes. As Guangdong is warm in winter and has more summer days and its average temperature is higher, people, in general, like light testes, resulting in the stress of Guangdong dishes on lightness, crispness and tastiness. They are exquisite in preparation, diversified in colors and patterns and artistic and novel in appearance.</p>

<p>It is these delicious and delicate local dishes of different patterns and styles that constitute the distinctive characteristics of Chinese cuisine.</p>
