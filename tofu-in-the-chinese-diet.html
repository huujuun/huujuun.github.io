    <p>The role of tofu in the Chinese diet has been likened to that of meat and milk in other cultures. This analogy is often pushed too far by the soy industry and various health gurus, but is far from completely ridiculous. Aside from the nutritional package it delivers, the brilliance of tofu lies in its versatility as it can be prepared in a multitude of ways and blends well with many other foods.</p>

<h3>Status of Tofu in Chinese Food</h3>

<p>It is tofu that has finally cemented the soybean’s role in Chinese cuisine. If rice and wheat are the carbohydrate canons, tofu puts loads of previously unavailable cheap protein on the table. Legend has it that tofu was discovered by Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, grandson of the founder of the Western Han Dynasty, Liu Bang. A key element of Taoism of the time was alchemy, and Liu An was a practitioner of this art, the forerunner of modern chemistry. Liu An, the story goes, created tofu in search for immortality or at least longevity.</p>

<p>Tofu and soy protein play a central role in the making of meat substitutes. Made of tofu and soy protein, mock meat remains a major feature at vegetarian restaurants and temple kitchens throughout China. Meat analogues can be amazingly meat-like. Mock meat can be eaten guilt-free, and it is much cheaper than the stuff hacked from the carcasses of animals, which means that you could eat more of it, and more often.</p>

<h3>Mapo Tofu</h3>

<p>Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province. It is a combination of tofu and minced meat, usually beef, in a spicy bean-based sauce. True Mapo Tofu is powerfully spicy with both conventional heat spiciness and the characteristic mala”(numbing spiciness) flavor of Sichuan cuisine. The authentic form of the dish is increasingly easier to find outside China today, but usually in Sichuan restaurants that do not adapt the dish for non-Sichuan tastes. Mapo Tofu is said to come from a pock- marked (possibly fictional) old lady, who made and sold the dish. “Ma” stands for mazi, which means a person disfigured by pockmarks. ”Po” means an old woman.</p>

<h3>Smelly Tofu</h3>

<p>Soy food has been in the ascendancy since the 1970s when it became the darling of vegetarians after belated recognition as a magic health food. Since then soy has worked its way into thousands of food products. China boasts its large variety of tofu, among which smelly tofu is the most notorious due to its noxious odor but delicious taste. The most famous smelly tofu brand in China is made by the Wang Zhihe Food Group in Beijing, which started its production in 1678. Wang Zhihe takes its name in honor of the man who invented the food; An interesting story arises concerning the nature of Wang Zhihe invention. As Wang Zhihe failed the Imperial Examinations, he was determined to take them again and set up a small tofu mill to finance his life in Beijing. However, his business did not progress as planned and there was extra tofu every day. One hot day in summer, Wang Zhihe cut his surplus tofu into small pieces and dried them to eat the next day. He put some salt and Chinese prickly ash onto the tofu to preserve them, and put them into a jar. However, he forgot all about them until several months later. When he opened the jar, a strong smell came out. To his surprise, the rotten tofu tasted great. He asked his neighbors to try them. They loved them and asked him to make more. Wang Zhihe never did pass his Imperial Examinations, but he made loads of money by selling smelly tofu and eventually set up a smelly tofu shop.</p>
