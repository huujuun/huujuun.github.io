    <p>China’s time-honored brands must have been inexistence before 1956 and highly popular among customers. The honor of the time-honored brands lies in its independent innovation and cultural transmission, as well as the symbol of enterprises ‘ undertaking more social responsibilities.

<h3>Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant</h3>

<p>Quanjude was established in 1864 during the Qing Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Tongzhi. The first Quanjude manager, Yang Renquan, paid a retired chef from the palace for the imperial recipe. Soon after, Quanjude became the first restaurant in the world to serve roast duck from the imperial kitchen to the common masses. On July 28, 2009, the chief chef of Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant pushed out the 148 millionth duck during the 145th anniversary celebration of the restaurant in Qianmen of Beijing.</p>

<p>From August 8, 2009 onwards, Quanjude will place a traceable barcode on every duck sold in its Beijing outlets. Consumers can get information about the cultivation and cooking of their ducks. According to sources, this traceable barcode dates back to last year’s Olympic Games. The Asian Games Village outlet has been a test center for the barcode. During the Beijing Olympics, the Beijing roast duck became a top favorite for global athletes, so the canteens in the Athletes Village had to double its daily supply from 300 to 600. To prepare the ducks, chefs from Quanjude Beijing Roast Duck chain were hired.</p>

<h3>Louwailou</h3>

<p>Louwailou, located at the foot of Gushan (Solitary Hill) near the beautiful West Lake, Hangzhou, has a history of more than150 years. It is well-known at home and abroad for its enjoying delicious dish and beautiful scenery at the same time.</p>

<p>As for the naming of this restaurant, there are two versions. One was that the owner, Hong Ruitang, having got inspired from a poem written by Lin Sheng, a poet in the Southern Song Dynasty. It runs (literally) as the green hill sets besides the mountain and a house sets outside another building, ceaseless dances and songs go along the West Lake, the breeze makes us imperious, and we are feeling like in Bianzhou (in Henan Province)instead of Hangzhou! “ Thus Louwailou comes from this poem. Another opinion was that because the restaurant was located in front of Yulou, a building owned by a famous scholar, YuQuyuan. Mr. Hong Ruitang asked Mr. Yu to name his restaurant. Mr. Yu said, Since your restaurant sets outside my house, we may refer to Lin Sheng’s famous poem and call it ‘Louwailou’.”These two parlances have both enhanced the cultural curiosity of the restaurant.</p>
